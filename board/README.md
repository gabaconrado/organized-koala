# Board

Coordination state for organized-koala (this replaces a ticket tracker). One file per work
item in `features/`; the `status:` frontmatter **is** the state machine. This dashboard is
**derived** — `eng-manager` regenerates it from item frontmatter; do not hand-edit as truth.

> The Board is committed and potentially public. **Never write secrets or sensitive payloads
> into any item.** Describe behaviour and shape.

## State machine

```text
inbox → planned → ready → working → review → awaiting-merge → merged | blocked
```

The AI cycle is terminal at `awaiting-merge`; only the human merges (→ `merged`). An item is
born on `main` during planning, then becomes **branch-owned on claim**: its live status
advances on the feature branch while `main`'s snapshot stays frozen at the claim until the
human's merge (see CLAUDE.md "The Board"). The `Status` column below shows `main`'s snapshot;
for an in-flight item the authoritative live status is on its branch.

## Items

| ID | Title | Status (main snapshot) | Priority | Depends on | Branch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [0001](./features/0001-foundational-slice.md) | Foundational vertical slice (auth + profile + minimal TODO) | planned | high | umbrella → 0002, 0003, 0004 | — |
| [0002](./features/0002-contract-crate.md) | Contract crate + workspace restructure (slice 1 of 0001) | in-flight (branch-owned) | high | — | feature/0002-contract-crate |
| [0003](./features/0003-server-auth-profile-tasks.md) | Server — auth, default profile, tasks, migrations, docker stack (slice 2 of 0001) | ready | high | 0002 | — |
| [0004](./features/0004-tui-foundational.md) | TUI — register/login, default profile, task add/list/close (slice 3 of 0001) | ready | high | 0003 | — |

> **Dependency chain (slice 0001):** `0002` (contract) → `0003` (server) → `0004` (TUI). `0001`
> is the umbrella tracking the three. `0002` is **in-flight and branch-owned** on
> `feature/0002-contract-crate` — its live status lives on the branch (the cycle drove it to
> AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` there); the human merges that branch (→ `merged`), which brings
> the finished item back to `main`. `0003` is unblocked and ready to claim once 0002 merges.
