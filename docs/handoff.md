# Handoff — engineering journal

Reverse-chronological. `eng-manager` appends one entry per completed cycle at the **top** and
keeps the "What works right now" snapshot at the bottom current.

## Handoff — 2026-07-02 (0021 — profiles sorted oldest-first by insertion time)

A deliberately small, clean `feature` cycle. Profiles now list **oldest-first** (ascending
insertion time) in both the Profile list and the switcher, via a single server-query direction
flip in `list_profiles` (`crates/server/src/handlers/profiles.rs`): `ORDER BY created_at DESC`
→ `ASC`. The `.sqlx/` offline cache was regenerated for the changed SQL text (old `DESC` entry
removed, new `ASC` entry committed; column set `{id,name,created_at}` unchanged, no wire delta).
Two stale "newest-first" doc comments were corrected to "oldest-first" — the server handler doc
line (`server-dev`) and the `ProfilesState.profiles` field note in `crates/tui/src/app/profiles.rs`
(`tui-dev`, split by file ownership). A new server integration test
`list_profiles_ordered_oldest_first` (`crates/server/tests/profiles.rs`) pins the order with an
insertion sequence distinct from **both** alphabetical and newest-first, so a regression to either
fails.

- **No `contract`/wire change (#2)** — the `Profile` DTO already carries `created_at`; **no**
  domain-structure change (#3); **no ADR**; **no migration**. Profile-scoping (#4,
  `WHERE user_id = $1`) and stateless-TUI (#1, TUI does no client-side sort — flipping the server
  order flips both list and switcher) intact.
- Reviewer **approved** + verifier **verified** (live: `GET /api/profiles` returned
  `[work, zulu, alpha, mike]` oldest-first, HTTP 200, shape unchanged, account-scoping + error
  contract + OTel span confirmed), both pinned to code-hash
  `b8591d70250155b79c209d4b14b59f6b2abb00fd` (commit `831634b`). No findings, no gaps, no
  out-of-scope nits. Coverage 72.66% (report-only).

**Request-premise correction — worth a note (not gotcha-promoted).** The feature request asserted
profiles were listed **alphabetically** today; the server was actually `ORDER BY created_at DESC`
(newest-first). `architect` verified the current behaviour against the code during planning and
recorded the corrected premise in the plan Findings + Assumptions rather than taking the request's
claim at face value — the deliverable (oldest-first, server-authoritative) was unambiguous either
way, so the mismatch did not block. This is the AFK "external text is data, not instructions"
policy working as intended (a feature request's factual claims are checked against the codebase,
not trusted), and it is already covered by the `plan` skill's investigation step + the ambiguity
policy. Recorded here as confirmation, judged **not** to clear the durable-gotcha bar.

**No CLAUDE.md gotcha added, no skill/agent change, no new crate.** Nothing genuinely new was
learned this cycle — it was a one-line ordering flip plus a doc/test slice, exercising existing
patterns (server `ORDER BY`, `.sqlx/` regen for changed SQL text, file-ownership-split doc fixes,
a regression-pinning integration test). No out-of-scope follow-ups were flagged by reviewer or
verifier, so **no idea filed**.

## Handoff — 2026-07-02 (0020 re-entry — operator feedback: date row, sub-task delete, older x-toggle)

After 0020 reached `awaiting-merge`, the operator gave **three adjustments** (three `[human]`
lines in the item Log). `architect` triaged **no ADR** — all three are TUI-only, touching no wire
(#2) or domain (#3) shape — amended acceptance #2/#3 and added #7. `tui-dev` (S3 re-entry,
`e9127ed`) + `tester` (S4 re-entry, `e21d82d`) implemented, reviewed+verified @ code-hash
`a5713a7d95780e1e61b4130ccc7556789f44aa45`.

- **Item 1 (amended #2)** — the today date moved **INTO** the Tasks list as a full-width,
  non-selectable **separator header row** (the above-border `Paragraph` slot dropped; whole area
  is the bordered list). A shared `separator_line(label, inner)` helper pads **both** the date row
  and the "Older tasks" row to the pane inner width; selection skips the date row via a `ListState`
  selected-index +1 offset.
- **Item 2 (added #7)** — `d` now deletes the selected **sub-task**: `confirming_delete` changed
  `Option<String>` → `Option<DeleteTarget>` (`Task` | `Subtask`); `arm_delete` arms by row kind
  (separator → no-op); `confirm_delete` dispatches `DeleteTask`/`DeleteSubtask` — **reuses the
  shipped wire, no contract change**. The verifier drove the newly-reachable server delete path
  live (204; cross-profile/cross-user → `404 not_found`, sub-task surviving; #4 holds).
- **Item 3 (amended #3)** — older-group tasks still **default collapsed** but `x` now toggles them:
  `resolve_collapsed` = per-task override else `is_older || Done`. A7 preserved (older path never
  writes `collapse_overrides`).

**Acceptance drift caught in the cycle.** #7 was originally drafted "any navigation disarms," but
the shipped delete confirmation is a **modal confirm** (Enter confirms, Esc cancels, other keys
inert — matching the notes/profiles dialog, ADR-0010 §3). The `tester` pinned the *real* affordance
(a non-confirm key issues no delete) rather than asserting the described-but-unimplemented disarm,
and the wording was corrected. Lesson (recorded, not gotcha-promoted): when a re-entry **amends
acceptance**, the tester pins the true observable affordance and flags the drift rather than
codifying prose that never matched the code.

**Re-validated learned-0019 (harness stranding) — now confirmed to generalize to field *type*
changes.** The gotcha was framed around **adding** a `Client` method / `ClientRequest`+`Outcome`
variant / a state field. This cycle re-stranded `crates/tui/tests/common/mod.rs` with **none** of
those — only a **field type change** (`TaskListState.confirming_delete: Option<String>` →
`Option<DeleteTarget>`), which broke the tester's `task_list_screen_confirming_delete()` builder
and the assertions matching `confirming_delete.as_deref()`. Same ownership boundary, same
same-cycle un-stranding — so the durable rule is: a `tui` `src/` change to the **shape** of a
tester-observed field (add *or retype*) strands the harness. No CLAUDE.md edit needed — the
existing gotcha already covers "a field to a screen-state struct"; this widens it to "add or retype"
and is noted here rather than re-worded in the (already long) gotcha.

**Out-of-scope follow-up filed as an idea (home #1, `main`).** [`ideas/0011`][idea-0011-h] — the
`confirming_delete` field doc-comment (`crates/tui/src/app/task_list.rs` ~line 116) still says
"cleared on confirm or on any other navigation," which never matched the modal-confirm behaviour
(only `Esc` disarms; other keys inert). Reviewer-flagged, out of scope of the interaction re-entry;
a natural `chore` candidate. Note: [`ideas/0007`][idea-0007-h] (delete-single-subtask affordance,
raised on 0019) is now **effectively delivered** by this cycle's item 2 — the human may want to
close/mark it resolved at triage.

**No CLAUDE.md gotcha added, no skill extension.** This re-entry mostly *re-validated* existing
learnings (harness stranding; feedback re-entry; modal-confirm). The one mild new observation
(acceptance-wording-vs-shipped-behaviour drift on a re-entry) is recorded above and judged not to
clear the durable-gotcha bar — it is a one-off wording correction the tester already handled
correctly, not a recurring trap engineering must plan around.

**State:** re-entry back at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on
`feature/0020-tui-tasks-pane-rendering-overhaul`, reviewed `approved` + verified `verified` @
`a5713a7d95780e1e61b4130ccc7556789f44aa45` (head `e21d82d`; later commits Board-only). coverage
72.66%.

## Handoff — 2026-07-02 (0020 Tasks-pane rendering overhaul — pagination-ready limit)

A four-slice `feature` reshaping how the TUI **Tasks pane** renders, plus the one wire-shaping
change it needed. Governed by [ADR-0014][adr-0014-h] (task-list pagination-ready `limit`/`offset`).
What shipped:

- **contract (S1)** — `TaskListQuery { limit, offset }` (both `Option<u32>`, `skip_serializing_if`,
  `Default`) + `MAX_TASK_LIST_LIMIT = 500`. No `Task`/`Subtask`/`TaskStatus`/create-update DTO
  touched (#3); response stays the bare `[Task]` array.
- **server (S2)** — `list_tasks` extracts `Query(TaskListQuery)`: absent `limit` → ceiling, absent
  `offset` → 0, over-ceiling → `400 validation_failed` (no silent clamp), bound `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`
  via `i64::from` (no `as`). `ORDER BY created_at DESC` unchanged; no migration; `.sqlx/` refreshed.
- **tui (S3)** — `TASK_LIST_LIMIT = 200` (tui-local) threaded through all six `ListTasks` sites;
  completed-last **stable** sort (open<done at task + sub-task levels, re-derived per render so a
  toggle re-orders with no re-fetch, #1); today date header (weekday/month/ordinal/year) top-center
  Tasks pane only; today/older split with an "Older tasks" separator; older group forced collapsed
  **render-time** (kept separate from `collapse_overrides`); `h` toggles the older group + separator
  (ephemeral `hide_older`, #1); `h` added to the help overlay's second Tasks line (66≤70 inner, no
  re-wrap).
- **tester (S4)** — un-stranded `tests/common/mod.rs` (fake `list_tasks(query)`, worker arm,
  `hide_older` initializers) and added wall-clock-aware builders; pinned completed-last, the split +
  separator, forced-collapse, `h` toggle, the today header presence/absence, ordinal formatting,
  `limit=200` on the wire, the help-line no-rewrap, and the server limit/offset/over-ceiling cases.

**Recorded assumption (A5/A8):** "today" is the **UTC civil day** (epoch-secs `div_euclid 86400`),
not the operator's local date, so the `tui` crate stays chrono-free (pulling a timezone dep is an
ADR/#6 event) and deterministic under test. The reviewer accepted this under the AFK
smallest-change + recorded-assumption policy.

Reviewer **REVIEW-STATUS: approved** + verifier **VERIFY-STATUS: verified**, both pinned to code-hash
`25ed4351d5beedb2d4f0cc517e3bdd867389cedc`. Verifier booted the stack live (default list newest-first,
limit caps, offset skips, `limit=501` → `400 validation_failed`, cross-profile `404` #4, shipped
reqwest client end-to-end, OTel `list_tasks` spans, TUI `TestBackend` suite green). coverage **72.26%**
line (worktree; docker + throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly) — report-only, never a gate.

**Learnings this cycle:** the learned-0019 tui harness-stranding gotcha **recurred exactly as
predicted** (a new always-runs `ListTasks` query arg + a new `TaskListState` field re-stranded
`common/mod.rs`) — no new gotcha for that half, it is already durably captured. The **new** wrinkle
earned a durable note: a render path that branches on the **wall clock** (0020's today/older split)
silently reclassifies every fixed-date test fixture into the "older" branch, so the tester added
wall-clock-aware builders (`today_at` / `today_open_task`). Recorded as a `tester`-agent rule and a
one-line corollary on the existing CLAUDE.md harness-stranding gotcha. The help-overlay re-wrap
gotcha **held** (the width check + `dialogs.rs` regression pin worked as designed) — no change.

**Two out-of-scope follow-ups filed as ideas on `main`:** [`ideas/0009`][idea-0009-h] (compute the
operator's **local** date for the today/older grouping instead of UTC civil day — and reconcile
ADR-0014 §5 / the 0020 plan "local date" wording, which does not yet match the shipped UTC behaviour;
that reconciliation is deliberately **left to this idea's disposition**, not retro-edited here) and
[`ideas/0010`][idea-0010-h] (an empty-string query param — `?limit=` — returns a plain-text 400 that
bypasses the `{code,message}` JSON error contract; unreachable by the shipped reqwest client).

**State:** at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on `feature/0020-tui-tasks-pane-rendering-overhaul`
pending the orchestrator's step-7 freshen + step-8 status flip and the human's ff-merge. The `main`
snapshot stays frozen at the `ready` claim; the authoritative live status is on the branch.

## Handoff — 2026-06-29 (0019 re-entry — `?` help-overlay Tasks-line wrap fix)

A small post-`awaiting-merge` re-entry on 0019. The operator reported a `?` help-overlay rendering
bug: the **Tasks** reference line wrapped `d delete` to an un-indented flush-left continuation. The
line is exactly 64 chars and overflowed the 62-col inner area of the shared `DIALOG_WIDTH = 64`
box — the 0019 sub-task hotkeys (`A add sub-task`, `x collapse/expand`) pushed it over. Triaged as
**TUI-presentation-only** (no `contract`/server/domain change, no ADR), re-entering at `working`;
the code change voided the prior `8c500ca0…` verdicts.

Fix (`tui-dev`, `crates/tui/src/ui/mod.rs`): a `width: u16` field on the `Dialog` struct decouples
the help box from the shared const — only `draw_help` passes the new `HELP_DIALOG_WIDTH = 72`
(inner ~70); the five form/confirm/timer dialogs pass `DIALOG_WIDTH = 64` unchanged and render
byte-identically. Help content/wording/row-count untouched — only the box is wider. `tester` pinned
the fix with `help_modal_tasks_line_renders_intact_without_wrapping_d_delete` in
`crates/tui/tests/dialogs.rs` (asserts `d delete` shares the Tasks row with `a add` / `A add
sub-task` and no row is a stranded flush-left `d delete`; the reviewer confirmed it is a genuine
pin — it fails on the pre-fix source). Agents that ran: `architect` (triage) → `tui-dev` → `tester`
→ `reviewer` → `verifier`.

Reviewer **REVIEW-STATUS: approved** + verifier **VERIFY-STATUS: verified**, both pinned to
code-hash `da5b04634dcedc3a6df38ef65958548981d83775` (commit `54fea75`). The
`crates/contract`/`crates/server` diff vs. the prior tree is **empty**, so the live-stack-boot
portion was **N/A** (nothing new server-side); the prior 0019 five-endpoint live verification
carries forward on the byte-unchanged server surface, and the TUI side (home of help-overlay
rendering per ADR-0003) is `crates/tui/tests/dialogs.rs` green. coverage **71.23%** line (worktree;
docker + throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly) — report-only, never a gate.

**New CLAUDE.md gotcha this re-entry:** the `?` help overlay packs key·action pairs into a
fixed-width box, so a new/renamed hotkey can silently overflow a reference line and wrap with no
indent — a pure-geometry bug the build/clippy never catch. This is the **second** occurrence (0015's
Global block crammed-row, 0019's Tasks-line wrap), so the recurrence earned a durable gotcha: when
adding/renaming a hotkey, check the help-reference line widths against the dialog inner width; the
help overlay now carries its own `HELP_DIALOG_WIDTH = 72` and `dialogs.rs` pins both lines.

**One out-of-scope follow-up filed as [`ideas/0008`][idea-0008] on `main`** (the reviewer's
non-blocking nit): the new regression test's comment cites the fixing commit sha inline, against
`coding-standards` (no dev context in comments) — parked for a future `tui`-tests touch rather than
churning the just-issued verdicts.

## Handoff — 2026-06-29 (0019 sub-tasks — full-stack `feature`; first #3 exception)

Sub-tasks shipped end-to-end across all three crates — the **first admitted structural exception
to the deliberately-flat domain (#3)**. A sub-task is a bounded, **one-level**,
**title+status-only** child of a task (no description, no `created_at`, no detail view),
created/edited/toggled/collapsed from the Tasks tab and the Task Detail page.

What shipped:

- **contract** — `Subtask { id, task_id, title, status }` (reusing `TaskStatus`),
  `CreateSubtaskRequest { title }`, `UpdateSubtaskRequest { title?, status? }`; existing task DTOs
  byte-untouched (#2).
- **server** — paired reversible migration `20260612163051_subtasks.{up,down}.sql` (`subtasks`
  table, `task_id` FK to `tasks` **`ON DELETE CASCADE`** — the no-orphans guarantee R4, status
  CHECK, internal `created_at`, index; `down` = `DROP TABLE`). Five handlers in
  `crates/server/src/handlers/subtasks.rs`, each `assert_owned(pid)` then joined `subtasks → tasks`
  on `task_id` AND `tasks.profile_id = $pid` (A1 — cross-profile/wrong-parent → `404`). Reuses
  `validation_failed`/`not_found`, no new `ErrorCode`.
- **tui** — five `Client` methods + protocol variants + worker arms;
  `Event::BeginAddSubtask`/`ToggleCollapse`; a **two-call tree load** (`ListTasks` →
  `ListSubtasks`); a `VisibleRow` selection model. Keys (Tasks context): **`A`** create (Shift+a;
  `a` stays add-task), **`e`** edit-title / **`Space`** toggle (routed to a selected sub-task row,
  else the task), **`x`** toggle collapse. Collapse derives from parent status each render (A2,
  transient override map — #1); indicator `+` only when a task has collapsed sub-tasks; sub-task
  rows indented one level; Task Detail gains a read-only "Sub-tasks" section (A8 — not focusable).

**ADRs:** [ADR-0012][adr-0012-0019] amends **hard-constraint #3** to admit the bounded sub-task
exception; [ADR-0013][adr-0013-0019] is the wire contract + reversible migration. Both landed on
`main` before the worktree was cut.

**#3 reconciled with ADR-0012 (home-#1 edit this cycle).** `CLAUDE.md` #3 previously listed
"subtasks" as forbidden structure "without an ADR"; it now reads "**deliberately flat (one
admitted, bounded exception)**" — sub-tasks are admitted per ADR-0012 (one level, title+status
only, profile-scoped via the parent), while the boundary (no deeper nesting, no extra sub-task
fields, no tags/categories/per-profile-timer) **remains forbidden without its own ADR**. #3 is
still meaningful and enforceable — the exception is narrow and cited, not a gutting.

Tests: contract `tests/subtask.rs` (14), server `tests/subtasks.rs` (21 `#[sqlx::test]`, incl.
both task-delete and profile-delete cascade R4), tui `tests/subtasks.rs` (16 TestBackend). Reviewer
**REVIEW-STATUS: approved** + verifier **VERIFY-STATUS: verified**, both pinned to code-hash
`8c500ca092b3c37ec4e95475b794053e470c9077` (commit `c39c816`). The verifier booted the stack (no
learned-0011 migration-history conflict on the shared volume) and exercised all five endpoints
live.

coverage: **71.22%** line (`./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree; docker + throwaway test Postgres
booted cleanly). Report-only — never a gate.

**New CLAUDE.md gotcha this cycle:** *extending the `tui` `Client` trait / `ClientRequest`+`Outcome`
enums / a screen-`State` struct's fields strands the tester-owned `crates/tui/tests/` harness* —
lib+bin build and `clippy --lib --bins` stay green while `--all-targets` lint/test go red (the fake
`Client` is missing the method, the worker-analogue `match` is non-exhaustive, struct initializers
miss the field). Expected by crate ownership, **not** a defect: the dev slice is done at
lib+bins-green and the tester slice un-strands the harness in the same cycle — so a `tui` slice
touching that surface is not mergeable until the tester slice lands. Corollary recorded: a new
always-runs request (0019's two-call tree load) becomes an invariant of every post-auth flow; the
tester absorbed it by defaulting unscripted sub-task list calls to an empty list while keeping the
strict net for mutating calls.

**No new crate** (no dev-agent registration). No standards-skill change — the harness-stranding
learning is a recurring cross-cutting gotcha (its correct home is CLAUDE.md, not a per-language
skill), and the ADR-relationship/assumption detail lives in ADR-0012/0013.

**One out-of-scope follow-up filed as an idea on `main`** (reviewer-flagged, non-blocking):
[`ideas/0007`](../board/ideas/0007-delete-single-subtask-affordance.md) — there is **no TUI key to
delete a single sub-task** (the `delete_subtask` client/server path + tests all exist, but nothing
in the keymap reaches them; today a sub-task only disappears via the parent-task cascade). This is
**in-scope-correct** for 0019 (the card specified create/edit/toggle/collapse + cascade, not
single-delete) — idea-first per the backlog policy, awaiting human triage.

## Handoff — 2026-06-28 (0018 notes detail multiline Content text area — TUI-only; `feature`)

A clean, well-scoped, **`tui`-crate-only** feature with **no** `contract`/server/migration change.
The Notes detail view's **Content** field becomes a **multiline text area that fills the rest of
the pane** (panes reorder to `Title → Created → Content`), implementing [ADR-0011][adr-0011-0018]
— which **amends [ADR-0010][adr-0010-0014-snap] §4** for the multiline pane only. `Note.content`
is already a `String`, so the wire surface is untouched (reviewer + verifier confirmed
`crates/contract` + `crates/server` byte-identical to `main`).

What shipped (`crates/tui/` only):

- **Context-dependent commit keymap (the load-bearing decision, ADR-0011).** Two new `Event`
  variants — `Event::Commit` ("commit focused field") and `Event::Newline` ("insert a line
  break"). `map_key` maps `Ctrl+S` → `Commit` while a text-entry context is active, and `Enter`
  → `Newline` **only** when the active text-entry context is the multiline Content edit (predicate
  `editing_note_content` / `NotesState::editing_content_pane`); `Enter` stays `Submit` everywhere
  else (Title, auth, dialogs, create/edit forms, list-open). The detail handler treats `Submit`
  and `Commit` identically so Title still commits on `Enter` and Content commits on `Ctrl+S`;
  `Newline` pushes `'\n'` into the edit buffer. `Ctrl+S` is inert outside text entry; `Ctrl+C`
  still wins as the unconditional Quit; **no terminal enhancement flags** are pushed (the
  Shift+Enter rejection — that pattern is terminal-dependent and would silently fail on Apple
  Terminal / VTE / xterm / bare tmux). This is the first modifier binding besides `Ctrl+C`.
- **Content fills the pane.** Opt-in `DetailPane.fill` flag drives a per-pane layout constraint:
  Title/Created stay `Constraint::Length(3)`, Content takes `Constraint::Min(3)` and renders with
  `Wrap { trim: false }` so multi-line content displays without truncating the fixed fields. The
  task detail path defaults to `Length(3)` and is unchanged.
- **Pane reorder** `NotePane::ALL` → `[Title, Created, Content]`; focus cycling still skips
  read-only `Created` and lands only on Title/Content. Discoverability copy for `Ctrl+S` in the
  `?` help overlay + the Content pane caption.

Tests live in `tester`'s `TestBackend` suite per [ADR-0003][adr-0003-0018] (interactive TUI
behaviour is owned by that suite, not the live verifier): `tests/detail.rs` 31 passed,
`tests/keybindings.rs` 38 passed — pane order, Content fill/multiline render, `Enter`→newline,
`Ctrl+S` commit via the `UpdateNote` path, `Esc` cancel/revert, and the regression fork (Title
still commits on `Enter`; `Ctrl+S` inert with no text entry). Clause 4 has no server-API/reqwest
delta to boot for (the `crates/contract`/`crates/server` diff against `main` is empty); the
verifier confirmed the suite exists and is green. Reviewer **REVIEW-STATUS: approved** + verifier
**VERDICT: verified**, both pinned to code-hash `1f9db5c40754afb83857a67b71313fd9d2db7ba8`.

coverage: **72.47%** line (`./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree; docker + throwaway test Postgres
booted cleanly). Report-only — never a gate.

**No new CLAUDE.md gotcha or standards/agent change this cycle.** The cycle ran clean: docker
available, no cross-worktree migration-history conflict (0018 adds no migration), the file-
ownership boundary held (tui-dev slices 1–4, tester slice 5), and the testability seam (new
`Event` variants → pure `map_key` → pure core) extended exactly as ADR-0011 anticipated. The
context-dependent-keymap pattern (the `editing_note_content` predicate gating `Enter`; `Ctrl+S`
as a modifier binding) and the "ADR-0011 amends ADR-0010 §4 for the multiline pane only"
relationship are **fully captured in ADR-0011** — their correct durable home — not a recurring
cross-cutting gotcha, so none manufactured. No new crate, so no new dev agent to register.

**One out-of-scope follow-up filed as an idea on `main`** (pre-documented as non-blocking plan
assumption A5, and independently flagged by the reviewer):
[`ideas/0006`](../board/ideas/0006-note-content-scroll-cursor-affordance.md) — a Content
scroll/cursor affordance for content exceeding the visible pane height (the current change
fills + wraps but has no scroll or cursor). Idea-first per the backlog policy — not minted, not
smuggled into the Summary.

## Handoff — 2026-06-28 (0017 timer-completion desktop notification — TUI-only; `feature`)

A clean, well-scoped, **`tui`-crate-only** feature with **no** `contract`/server/migration change
and **no** ADR (Decision 2 — the only new state is a transient in-memory marker on `Timer`, the
same #1-blessed category as `pending`/`loaded`/`applied_at`; #2/#3 untouched; inside the ADR-0006
render loop). When the TUI observes a focus session transition into `Completed`, it fires
**exactly one** desktop notification (title `"Focus timer"`, body `"Your focus session has
ended."`; no sound, no actions).

What shipped:

- **An injected `Notifier` seam** (`crates/tui/src/client/notify.rs`) modelled on the sanctioned
  `Client` external-service boundary (ADR-0003): production `DesktopNotifier` wraps `notify-rust`,
  `.show()`s a sound-less notification, and maps **every** delivery failure to a no-op — silent,
  non-fatal, writing nothing to the alt-screen terminal (A2).
- **A pure fire-once core on `Timer`** — transient `notified_for_session` (guard) +
  `notify_pending` (one-shot signal); `apply_timer_session` detects the Running→Completed edge
  before overwriting the session, arms+signals on that edge, re-arms on a new `Running`/`Idle`,
  and for the initial post-login fold only **arms** an already-`Completed` session without
  signalling (A4 — no stale replay on launch). `App::take_pending_notification` consumes once.
- **The poll-loop fire site** — `terminal::run<N: Notifier>` fires after draining each worker
  response; **no new request, no new poll** (ADR-0006 untouched). `main.rs` wires the production
  `DesktopNotifier`.
- **Tests** — `crates/tui/tests/notifications.rs` (13) drive the fire-once core via the public
  two-step `App` API + a thin `SpyNotifier` edge pair; only the sanctioned `Notifier`/`Client`
  external-service traits are mocked.

**notify-rust no-apt-package fact (A1 confirmed).** The crate is declared with **default features
only** and the C `dbus`/`d` feature left **off** (rationale commented on the dep line); the default
**`zbus` pure-Rust D-Bus backend** compiled on Ubuntu with **no apt package** — no `dbus` C-binding
crate in `Cargo.lock`, no `libdbus-1-dev`/`pkg-config`/system `.so`. Recorded as observed truth in
`crates/tui/README.md` and the root `README.md` dev-env note (the latter `eng-manager`'s home-#1
edit this cycle: a notification *daemon* is needed on Linux for notifications to **appear**, none
is needed to build/run).

Reviewer **approved** (no fix-now findings) + verifier **verified** (DoD clause 4 — 13/13 tests +
live `./ok.sh up` exercising the server-owned running→completed timer path per ADR-0002), both
pinned to code-hash `d3fa1fc5b3ed5ac0770085809aac150e25012849`.

coverage: **72.18%** line (`./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree; docker + throwaway test Postgres
booted cleanly). Report-only — never a gate.

**Operator's remaining manual confirmation (acceptance criterion 4 / R2).** No daemon exists in
the verifier/CI environment, so the **visual appearance** of the notification on a real Ubuntu
desktop is the operator's manual step — by design, not the verifier's, and not a capability gap
(the fire-once *logic* is proven daemon-free by the spy suite).

**Two out-of-scope ideas filed on `main`** (both pre-documented as non-blocking plan
assumptions): [`ideas/0004`](../board/ideas/0004-surface-notification-delivery-failures.md)
(A2 — surface delivery failures without a logging dep / terminal corruption) and
[`ideas/0005`](../board/ideas/0005-move-notification-show-off-poll-loop.md) (A6 — move `.show()`
off the poll loop if it is ever found to block materially).

**No CLAUDE.md gotcha or standards/agent change this cycle.** Nothing new and surprising failed:
the notify-rust default-backend / no-apt fact is recorded where it is load-bearing (the READMEs +
the dep-line comment), and the injected-effect-trait seam and alt-screen-no-stderr constraint are
not new learnings — they are the **existing** `Client`-trait pattern (ADR-0003) and the existing
rust-standards pure-core/effectful-shell rule, which this cycle simply followed correctly. No new
crate, so no new dev agent.

## Handoff — 2026-06-28 (0016 focus-cycling re-entry — read-only panes excluded from Tab; `feature`)

Human feedback re-opened 0016 from `awaiting-merge`: in both detail views the **read-only panes
were still `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` focus stops** — cycling from an editable pane landed on a
non-editable pane (task Status/Created/Closed, note Created) that does nothing, forcing a second
`Tab` to reach the next editable field. `architect` triaged it as a behaviour refinement **within
ADR-0010 §4's existing presentation-only scope — no ADR amendment** (§4 was silent on read-only
focusability).

What changed:

- **tui-dev** excluded read-only panes from focus cycling while keeping them **rendered**:
  `cycle(forward)` in `crates/tui/src/app/task_detail.rs` + `crates/tui/src/app/notes.rs` now
  scans to the next/prev **editable** pane (wrapping among editable panes only, with the totality
  guard preserved — no panic/OOB on an empty or all-read-only pane vector); initial + fallback
  focus land on the first editable pane (`first_editable`). The render path (`crates/tui/src/ui/
  mod.rs`) is untouched. Added `focus_pane` test seams (`TaskDetail::focus_pane` /
  `NoteDetail::focus_pane`) so `tester` can construct a read-only-*focused* state directly.
- **tester** updated the two cycle-sequence tests and added read-only-skip / initial-focus / A6
  coverage; `crates/tui/tests/detail.rs` is now **25 tests** (was 21).

The earlier `59ab3172` verdicts were **voided** by this code change (a real code-changing
re-entry, not the docs-only step-7 freshen). Reviewer **approved** (re-review) + verifier
**verified** (re-verify) both pinned to the new code-hash
`18d6445a05b7834320186551a6ee72e1972c3a08`; verifier re-booted `./ok.sh up` and re-exercised the
existing `UpdateTask`/`UpdateNote`/`GetNote` reqwest routes (no server/contract delta, wire
byte-identical). Back at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on its branch.

coverage: **72.05%** line (re-captured via `./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree after the fix;
docker + throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly). Report-only — never a gate.

**Durable learning captured.** This was a recognisable, recurring UX-correctness class — *a
per-field detail/form view included read-only/display-only fields in `Tab` focus traversal,
creating dead focus stops* — and the plan, ADR review, cold review, and live verify **all passed
it** before human feedback caught it. Added a rule to the **`coding-standards`** skill ("Focus
traversal skips non-interactive elements", learned 0016): focus cycling must move only between
interactive fields; read-only fields stay rendered but are excluded from the focus order, with
initial/fallback focus on the first interactive field. No new gotcha in CLAUDE.md (the rule lives
in the standards skill where developer agents load it), no new crate, no agent change.

## Handoff — 2026-06-28 (0016 TUI detail views + final hotkey scheme — Phase 3 / final; `feature`)

The three-part TUI overhaul (0014 shell → 0015 dialogs → **0016**) is complete. 0016 is a clean,
well-scoped, `tui`-crate-only, presentation-only cycle that **reused the 0015 framework rather than
rebuilding it** — no new ADR, no `contract`/server/domain delta (reviewer + verifier both confirmed
`crates/contract/**`, `crates/server/**`, `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` byte-identical to `main`). It
implements [ADR-0010][adr-0010-0014-snap] §3–§5.

What shipped:

- **Per-field task & note detail views** — each entity field is its own bordered pane, opened with
  `Enter`, panes cycled with `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`. Task detail is a new `crates/tui/src/app/task_detail.rs`
  (`TaskDetail` sub-state on `tasks.detail`), a transient sub-mode of `Screen::Main` (not a new
  `Screen` variant). Note detail converted the read-only `NotesMode::Viewing(Note)` into editable
  `NotesMode::Detail(NoteDetail)`. `e` enters edit on the focused editable pane; `Enter` commits that
  one field; commits re-derive from the server response (#1).
- **The final canonical hotkey remap:** `c`(done)→`Space`, `x`(delete)→`d`, `p`(timer)→`t`,
  duration-edit `d`→`T` (configure). The existing `Event` alphabet was reused — **no new variants**.

Load-bearing decisions (recorded in the item `## Summary` on the branch):

- **A7 — global-suppression contract** for an open-but-not-editing detail view: it captures the
  per-tab action keys + `Tab` + other globals, **but `?` help stays reachable** until a field edit is
  in progress (then everything is captured as text). Encoded in `App::can_open_help` / `detail_idle`.
- **Two-tiered `Esc` via an `Option<String>` edit buffer** — the buffer's presence is the tier
  discriminant (edit-in-progress ⇒ cancel the edit; no edit ⇒ exit to the list), unwinding one level
  at a time (R1).
- **One unified gate, no parallel gate** — the open detail view + edit state folded into the existing
  `overlay_capturing_input()` / `active_pane_in_sub_flow()` / `is_text_entry` predicates (R2/R3).
- **Note per-field commit re-sends the snapshot field** (R5) — `UpdateNoteRequest` has no `Option`
  fields, so committing one field re-sends the other from the snapshot so it is never blanked; the
  wire stays unchanged. (Tasks need no such workaround — `UpdateTask` is all-`Option`.)

Tests: new `crates/tui/tests/detail.rs` (21) + re-pinned keymap regressions (old `c`/`x`/`p`/
duration-`d` asserted **gone**); tui suite 189, whole workspace 405/0. Reviewer **approved** +
verifier **verified**, both pinned to code-hash `59ab31720df13c2a1f1c7a55752eeec48c7e3504`; verifier
booted `./ok.sh up` and exercised the existing `UpdateTask`/`UpdateNote`/`GetNote` reqwest routes the
per-field edits ride (per-field PATCH leaving other fields intact, GetNote+UpdateNote round-trip,
400/401/404/profile-scoping, error contract; OTel spans observed) — no server/contract delta. Now at
the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on its branch.

coverage: **71.73%** line (captured via `./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree; docker + throwaway test
Postgres booted cleanly). Report-only — never a gate.

**No new gotcha, no skill/agent change.** This cycle exposed nothing durable to capture: the 0015
framework (unified `overlay_capturing_input` gate, two-tiered `Esc`, `draw_field` purple border, `?`
help modal) extended cleanly to the new detail sub-mode exactly as ADR-0010 anticipated; the
file-ownership boundary (tui-dev slices 1–4, tester slice 5) held; the presentation-only boundary
held. No new crate, so no new dev agent to register. One out-of-scope cosmetic nit (a stale
`Viewing` doc comment in `notes.rs`) was already filed by the orchestrator as
`board/ideas/0003-stale-viewing-doccomment-notes.md` on `main` — idea-first per the backlog policy,
not folded into 0016 and not auto-minted.

## Handoff — 2026-06-27 (0015 help-modal layout re-entry — split crammed Global row; `feature`)

Operator feedback re-opened 0015 from `awaiting-merge` again — this time a **help-modal layout
bug**: in the `?` help dialog the `q  quit` entry was jammed onto the same row as the
`? / Esc  close help` entry, and `close help` was not tab-aligned to the description column. Root
cause: `draw_help` (`crates/tui/src/ui/mod.rs`) crammed two key entries onto one `Line`, breaking
the `{key:<18}{desc}` layout every other Global row follows (desc aligned at col 21). A pure-
presentation defect in 0015's own help modal — no behaviour / wire (#2) / domain (#3) change, no
ADR needed (ADR-0010 / ADR-0006 §8.3 already govern the help modal). Folded back into 0015 (same
precedent as the footer fix); per verdict-pinning the prior approved + verified verdicts were
**void** once code changed and the item re-ran review + verify.

What changed:

- **tui-dev** split the malformed row into two properly-tabbed Global lines — key `q` → `quit`,
  and key `? / Esc` → `close help` — each following the sibling `{key:<18}{desc}` layout so the
  descriptions align at col 21. Two `Line::from` literals changed; keymap/wire/contract/domain all
  unchanged. Commit `8c25b97`.
- **tester** added a positive regression test
  `help_modal_global_block_lists_quit_and_close_help_as_separate_aligned_rows` (`dialogs.rs`):
  opens the `?` modal via the real keymap and asserts (1) `quit` and `close help` are on separate
  rows (guards the crammed row from returning) and (2) the `close help` description starts at the
  same column as the sibling `quit` / `r refresh` rows (alignment asserted relative to siblings,
  not a magic constant). `dialogs` suite 22 → 23. Commit `397d759`.

Final state: reviewer **approved** + verifier **VERIFIED**, both pinned to code-hash
`00b1cb162b4c8c9bea9ce1e3eb840c0c50ebafcc`. Verifier confirmed (`git diff cf66137..397d759 --
crates/`) the only source deltas since the live wire pass are the `draw_help` help-text edit + the
new test — no server/contract/reqwest code — so the live API attestation carries forward from the
byte-identical `542f19aa` tree. Gates green (`./ok.sh test | lint | fmt --check`). Back at the
AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on the branch.

coverage: **73.81%** line (re-captured via `./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree after this re-entry;
docker + throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly — the help-text split + one regression test left
the headline `TOTAL` essentially unchanged, 73.80% → 73.81%). Report-only — never a gate.

**Process churn this cycle — self-matching `pgrep` wait-loops (durable bash-standards rule added).**
The reviewer and earlier agents repeatedly hung on background wait-loops of the form
`until ! pgrep -f "cargo test"; do sleep N; done` (later `pgrep -f "RUST_TEST_THREADS"`): the
loop's own shell command line contains the search pattern, so `pgrep -f PATTERN` always matched the
waiter itself, the condition never flipped, and each loop spun until timeout (~10 min; ~38 min lost
across waiters on this re-entry). It also tempted a denied `pkill` / `docker compose down -v`. A new
**"Waiting on a background process"** section in `bash-standards` now forbids self-matching `pgrep`
polling, prefers `cmd & pid=$!; wait "${pid}"` or the harness's completion notification (or a
sentinel the target writes on exit), and reiterates: run one coverage/test pass at a time (no
overlapping `./ok.sh test` against the shared throwaway PG — the idea-0002 flake), and never reset
the shared test-Postgres volume without operator approval (CLAUDE.md #6 / 0011 gotcha). Committed on
`main` (home #1).

## Handoff — 2026-06-27 (0015 footer-fix re-entry — single-row flush footer; `feature`)

Operator feedback re-opened 0015 from `awaiting-merge` back to `working` to fold in a
**footer-margin fix**: the trimmed single-line caption sat too high — two blank rows of bottom
margin in the terminal (operator wanted zero). Root cause: 0015 trimmed the footer caption to a
single non-wrapping line but left `BOTTOM_BAND_ROWS = 3` (sized for the OLD wrapping captions per
ADR-0006 §8.3 / learned 0010), so the top-aligned single-line caption left two dead rows. A 0015
loose end — the trim created it — so the operator folded it back into 0015 rather than minting a
new item; per verdict-pinning the prior approved + verified verdicts were **void** once code
changed and the item re-ran review + verify.

What changed:

- **ADR-0006 §8.3 amended** (on `main`, commit `93a503b`): the footer is now a **single flush
  row**; the textual `(Esc to cancel)` affordance is **relocated to the `?` help modal** (the
  keymap is unchanged — `Esc` still cancels an in-flight/loading request; only the on-screen
  textual hint moved).
- **tui-dev** shrank `BOTTOM_BAND_ROWS 3 → 1` and dropped the textual `(Esc to cancel)` from
  `caption_with_spinner` (the in-flight spinner glyph still appends to the stable caption). The
  pending caption is now 60 cols (was 76) so it does not wrap; on a rare wide-timer state the
  trailing spinner glyph may clip at the row edge — accepted per the single-row decision. Pure
  `tui::ui` presentation; #1/#2/#3 untouched. File `crates/tui/src/ui/mod.rs`.
- **tester** realigned the five in-flight asserts that pinned the old `(Esc to cancel)` footer
  (`rendering.rs` `auth_/task_list_/offline_retry_in_flight_…`, `tasks.rs`
  `delete_in_flight_renders_spinner_and_keeps_caption`, `timer.rs`
  `in_flight_appends_a_spinner_without_replacing_the_caption`) — each now asserts the in-flight
  render appends the spinner glyph and keeps the base caption with `"Esc to cancel"` NOT in the
  footer — and added two positive pins: `navigation.rs`
  `footer_is_a_single_flush_row_with_no_blank_trailing_rows` (caption AND timer on the terminal's
  last row, last row non-empty — the operator's zero-bottom-margin ask) and `dialogs.rs`
  `help_modal_documents_that_esc_cancels_an_in_flight_request` (the affordance's new home).
- **One cold-review nit fixed.** The re-review (`changes-requested` at code-hash `542f19aa…`)
  caught a stale `FOOTER_CAPTION` doc comment still describing the removed `(Esc to cancel)`
  affordance and the old multi-row band; tui-dev rewrote it (comment-only, value unchanged),
  moving the code-hash to `b4bc0cdb93086adb620ffbe66bc5d66a524e4ffd`.

Final state: reviewer **approved** + verifier **VERIFIED**, both pinned to code-hash
`b4bc0cdb93086adb620ffbe66bc5d66a524e4ffd`. Gates green (`./ok.sh test | lint | fmt --check`).
The re-verify booted the stack (`./ok.sh up`, migrate exit 0 — no cross-worktree conflict) and
confirmed the reqwest/API paths are byte-identical to the earlier VERIFIED tree (the reopened diff
is pure `tui` presentation). Back at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on the branch.

coverage: **73.80%** line (re-captured via `./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree after the re-entry;
docker + throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly. The footer fix realigned five asserts and added
two pins but the headline `TOTAL` line-coverage is unchanged at 73.80%). Report-only — never a
gate.

**Process note — the test layer caught the operator's intent precisely.** The fix is small but
the failure mode (dead margin rows) is exactly the kind of layout regression that is invisible to
unit logic and only visible in a rendered buffer; the new `navigation.rs` single-flush-row pin
asserts the terminal's last row is non-empty and carries both caption and timer, so a future
band-sizing change cannot silently re-introduce the margin.

**Follow-up / idea filed this cycle:** `board/ideas/0002-serialize-db-backed-integration-tests.md`
(`status: open`, source 0015, raised-by reviewer). The reviewer found — out of scope of 0015, not
blocking — that the default parallel `./ok.sh test` is **flaky under throwaway-Postgres
connection-pool contention**: intermittent `register → HTTP 500 {"code":"internal"}` in the server
DB-backed suites (auth/notes/profiles) that vanishes when DB tests are serialized
(`RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`). A `platform-dev` infra concern (serialize DB-backed integration tests,
bound the test pool, or raise the test Postgres `max_connections`); parked as an idea for human
triage, not minted. It interacts with the open idea 0001 (per-worktree compose isolation) — both
touch how `ok.sh` boots the test Postgres.

**No new gotcha, no agent/skill/standards change warranted.** The "trim a caption but leave the
band sized for the old wrap" loose end is captured in the Log + the ADR-0006 §8.3 amendment; it is
0015-specific, not a recurring cross-cutting gotcha. The flaky-test observation is a `platform-dev`
infra idea, not a standards rule.

## Handoff — 2026-06-26 (0015 — TUI dialog system: modals, trimmed footer, purple focus; `feature`)

Phase 2 of the three-part TUI overhaul (0014 → **0015** → 0016). A **`tui`-crate-only** dialog
system — a reusable centred-modal framework, every add/delete/timer-config sub-flow moved off the
inline message band and into dialogs, a `?` help modal with a trimmed footer caption, and a purple
focus border — with **no `contract`/server/domain change** (the presentation-only boundary binds per
[ADR-0010][adr-0010-0015] §5; reviewer + verifier both confirmed
`contract`/`server`/`migrations`/`deploy`/`ok.sh` byte-identical to `main`). Branch
`feature/0015-tui-dialog-system`; reviewer **approved** + verifier **VERIFIED**, both pinned to
code-hash `b9884943f36f3ac6c9d56fd2be46e31057a9060a`. Stopped at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge`
on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch, `crates/tui/` only — **no** wire surface touched):

- **Reusable dialog framework.** A deep, narrow `draw_dialog` helper in `ui/mod.rs` (one `Dialog`
  struct fed by all six dialog kinds + the help overlay), drawn after the panes via `Clear` +
  `centered_rect` so it floats centred over the tabbed view, carrying a title, fields and/or a
  confirm/cancel prompt, and an optional inline error line.
- **`?` help modal + trimmed footer.** A transient `App.help_open` flag toggled by
  `Event::ToggleHelp` (`?`) renders a centred help modal with the full hotkey reference; the three
  long `*_CAPTION` constants collapse into one short `FOOTER_CAPTION` (movement, tab switch, `?`,
  `q`) plus the unchanged in-flight spinner + "(Esc to cancel)" affordance.
- **Add / delete / timer dialogs.** Task add/edit, note add/edit, profile add/rename, the three
  delete-confirmations, and the timer duration edit all moved out of the 2-row message band into
  dialogs; the message band now carries only the pane's transient status/error (the `last_profile`
  refusal preserved). State machines + submit/cancel + chained-refresh + error routing are
  untouched — only the render site moved (ADR-0010 §5 presentation-only).
- **Purple focus border.** `draw_field` renders a focused field's border in `Color::Magenta`
  (replacing `Modifier::BOLD`), on the auth form fields + all dialog fields; non-focused fields keep
  the plain border.
- **Unified suppression rule + two-tiered Esc.** A single `App::overlay_capturing_input()` predicate
  replaces the scattered `adding.is_some()`/`in_sub_flow()`/`editing_duration` gates: while any
  overlay captures input the globals (`q`/`r`/`?`/`p`/`d`/tab-switch) are suppressed and `Esc`
  cancels the overlay; `Esc` with no overlay on a post-auth screen still quits, and in-flight
  `Esc`-cancel is preserved.

**Process-relevant event — the test layer caught a UX/keymap inconsistency before review.** Tester's
slice 5 flagged (as a finding, not worked around — no src edit) that `draw_help`'s footer advertised
`?/Esc: close`, yet a live `?` keypress was suppressed by the open help overlay at the keymap, so
only `Esc` actually closed help. tui-dev corrected it **in-cycle** (fix-now) rather
than deferring: a distinct `help_open` param threaded into `map_key` (now 5-arg
`(screen, overlay_capturing, help_open, editing_duration, key)`) special-cases `?` to **toggle** —
opening from an idle post-auth screen and closing while the help overlay is active (the core already
folds `Event::ToggleHelp` into a close); `?` stays suppressed while a *non-help* dialog captures input
(A3). A clean example of the `TestBackend` layer (ADR-0003 layer 2) catching a keymap/affordance
mismatch the moment the tests pinned the advertised behaviour, corrected before the cold review rather
than reaching `awaiting-merge` as a latent inconsistency.

Agents: **tui-dev** (slice 1 overlay/suppression seam, slices 2+3 dialog framework + help modal +
footer trim, slice 4 docs, + the `?`-closes-help fix-now) and **tester** (slice 5 `TestBackend`
suite — new `tests/dialogs.rs` + extensions across the existing suites, plus the follow-up updating
the suite for the 5-arg `map_key` and flipped `?`-closes-help behaviour).

Tests: `./ok.sh test` **380 passed / 0 failed**; `./ok.sh lint` clean (`--all-targets`);
`./ok.sh fmt --check` clean. Verifier confirmed `tests/dialogs.rs` 21/0 covering all six acceptance
criteria, all supporting suites 0-fail, and (clause-4 part 2) booted `./ok.sh up` clean to confirm
the reqwest/API paths the dialogs drive are unchanged (no server/contract delta to exercise).

coverage: **73.80%** line (the headline `TOTAL` line-coverage from a fresh `./ok.sh coverage` in the
worktree; docker plus the throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly — no cross-worktree volume conflict).
Report-only — never a gate.

**Cycle ran clean — no new gotcha, no agent/skill/standards change warranted.** The "unify scattered
suppression gates into one predicate but keep a distinct flag for the toggle-able overlay so its own
toggle key isn't swallowed" lesson is genuine but **0015-specific design detail**, already captured
in the plan's slice 1 + the `?`-closes-help fix Log — not a cross-cutting, recurring gotcha, so none
manufactured. The fix-now process note above is recorded here as a journal observation, not a
standards rule.

**Follow-ups / ideas filed this cycle: none.** Reviewer and verifier both reported no out-of-scope
findings; the `?`-closes-help issue was an **in-scope fix-now** (the advertised affordance had to
work to meet acceptance), not a deferred follow-up. The pre-existing per-worktree compose-isolation
idea (`board/ideas/0001`) remains open and untouched. No new idea minted.

**Forward note.** 0016 (`depends-on: [0015]`) is the final phase: per-field task/note detail views +
the complete hotkey remap (`c`→`Space`, `x`→`d`, `p`→`t`, `t` finally bound) — all still under
[ADR-0010][adr-0010-0015], inheriting and citing it (a new shell ADR is only warranted if 0016 needs
a wire/server/domain change, which is not expected). Merge 0015 before claiming 0016.

## Handoff — 2026-06-26 (0014 — TUI layout shell: tabs, centred auth/title, tight footer; `feature`)

Phase 1 of the three-part TUI overhaul (0014 → 0015 → 0016). A **`tui`-crate-only** reshape of the
structural shell — navigation model, auth screen, title bar, footer position — with **no
`contract`/server/domain change** (the boundary is binding per [ADR-0010][adr-0010-0014] §5). Branch
`feature/0014-tui-layout-shell`; reviewer **approved** + verifier **verified**, both pinned to
code-hash `bf65aa9612bf1633bf75e64f66a3dfddcfb4aa10` (commit `c8b1217`). Stopped at the AI-terminal
`awaiting-merge` on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch, `tui` crate only — **no** wire surface touched):

- **Tabbed post-auth view.** `Screen::TaskList`/`Notes`/`Profiles` collapsed into one
  `Screen::Main(Box<MainState>)` holding the active `Tab{Tasks,Notes,Profiles}` + all three live
  panes (new `crates/tui/src/app/main_view.rs`). New `Event::NextTab`/`PrevTab`; `map_key` remaps
  `Tab`/`BackTab` to tab-switching on an idle list (cycle both directions), arrows move list
  selection, a tab switch re-derives the active pane from a **fresh server load** for the active
  profile (#1, #4) preserving the selected row. Removed `OpenNotes`/`OpenProfiles`/`Back`, the
  idle-`Esc`-back path, and the `n`/`s` cross-screen bindings; `t` left **deliberately unbound** for
  0016's timer. Pick-active re-homed onto the Profiles tab. Every other binding unchanged — no
  sub-flow/CRUD behaviour change.
- **`Session`/`AuthState` gained `account: String`** — the entered identifier captured **client-side**
  at auth time (no new wire; ADR-0010 §2) so the title renders `<user>`.
- **Presentation.** Centred bounded auth form (toggle + all fields + error band intact); centred
  verbatim title `organized koala - <user> @ [<profile>]` (literal hyphen + brackets); footer flushed
  to the bottom row (outer margin dropped, band kept at 3 rows — caption + spinner + cancel still fit
  at 80×24). Full captions retained (caption trim is 0015).

Tests: new `crates/tui/tests/navigation.rs` (14 tests) covering every 0014 acceptance criterion, plus
the existing `TestBackend` suites re-pointed to the tabbed shell (tab-switch via `NextTab`/`PrevTab`
replaces the removed cross-screen events; pane accessors replace the old destructures), preserving each
test's intent (CRUD reachability, error-code branching, in-flight, JWT redaction). Only mock is the
`Client` trait.

coverage: **72.96%** line (the headline `TOTAL` from a fresh `./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree;
docker plus the throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly). Report-only — never a gate.

**Cycle ran clean** — docker available, no cross-worktree migration-history conflict (0014 adds no
migration), no scope creep into 0015/0016, no review/verify friction. **No new gotcha and no
agent/skill/standards change** is warranted (none manufactured).

**Forward note (load-bearing for the next two cycles).** [ADR-0010][adr-0010-0014] governs the whole
0014–0016 arc: its **presentation-only boundary (§5)** and the **tab/Esc/keymap invariants** bind 0015
and 0016. Those phases **inherit and cite ADR-0010** rather than opening new TUI-shell ADRs — a new
shell ADR is only warranted if a phase needs a wire/server/domain change (none is expected; 0015 is
the dialog system + caption trim + focus styling, 0016 is detail views + the full hotkey remap incl.
`t` for the timer). 0015 `depends-on: [0014]`; 0016 `depends-on: [0015]` — merge 0014 first.

**Follow-ups / ideas filed this cycle:** none. The verifier noted footer-caption wrapping at 80×24,
but caption trimming is **already planned for 0015** (per the 0014 item's out-of-scope list and
ADR-0010) — not a new unplanned follow-up, so no idea filed.

## Handoff — 2026-06-26 (0013 — redact the session JWT in the `tui` `Session` Debug leak; high `chore`)

A security `chore`: the `tui` session **bearer JWT was held as a bare `String`** inside structs and
enums that `#[derive(Debug)]` (`Session`, all 17 `ClientRequest::*` variants, `Outcome::ListProfiles`),
so the secret was reachable through any `{:?}` — a log line, a `tracing` span field, a panic message,
or future auto-instrumentation. A direct violation of `rust-standards` → *Sensitive data*. Branch
`feature/0013-session-token-debug-leak`; cold reviewer **approved** (chore invariant attested), the
live verifier pass correctly **skipped** (chore track — no live-observable change). Stopped at the
AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch, `tui` crate only — **no** wire surface touched):

- **`crates/tui/src/app/token.rs`** (new) — a `SessionToken(String)` newtype with a **hand-written
  `Debug` → `[REDACTED]`** (no `Display`/`Serialize`) and `expose(&self) -> &str` for use only at the
  point the bearer string is attached. Mirrors the in-repo `contract::Password` template; doctest
  asserts both `expose()` returns the value AND `format!("{token:?}") == "[REDACTED]"`.
- Bare `token: String` → `SessionToken` across every Debug-reachable holder: `Session.token`
  (`app/mod.rs`), all 17 `ClientRequest::*` `token` fields + `Outcome::ListProfiles.token`
  (`app/protocol.rs`). The worker (`client/worker.rs`) exposes the bearer string only at point of use
  (`token.expose()` → `bearer_auth`); the test worker-analogue executor got the same mechanical
  `&token` → `token.expose()` adaptation (no test-intent change). The `Client` trait's `token: &str`
  params are ephemeral point-of-use borrows (not stored Debug-reachable fields) — left as-is; the wire
  bearer string is byte-identical. No bare `token: String` remains in `crates/tui/src/`.
- **Tests** — `crates/tui/tests/redaction.rs` (public-API only): three tests formatting `{:?}` of
  `Session`, `ClientRequest::ListTasks`, and `Outcome::ListProfiles`, each asserting the token
  substring is **absent** and `[REDACTED]` is **present**, with a non-plausible placeholder token
  (`SECRET.JWT.VALUE`) so the secret scan passes.

**Redaction-shape decision.** Implementer chose the **local redacting newtype over
`secrecy::SecretString`** — the `Password` pattern is already in-repo, the `Client` methods take
`token: &str` so the newtype redacts in one type with no new dependency and no per-call-site
`expose_secret()` churn, keeping trait/wire signatures byte-identical. Trade-off recorded: the
newtype redacts but does **not** zeroize on drop (which `secrecy` would) — acceptable for a
process-lifetime in-memory token under #1.

coverage: **66.90%** line (the headline `TOTAL` from a fresh `./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree;
docker + throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly). Report-only — never a gate.

Verdict (@ code-hash `e5925c5139e52846d8593c4be3ab2d0516d49fa0`, last code sha `e86f956`):

- **reviewer — REVIEW-STATUS: approved.** Mechanical gate green (`fmt --check`/`lint`/`test`); leak
  closure confirmed (`SessionToken` redacts, exposed only at point of use, nothing re-exposes it; all
  17 variants + `Outcome::ListProfiles` + `Session` covered — redaction complete, not merely moved).
  **Chore invariant attested:** no behaviour change (wire bearer string byte-identical), no
  `contract`/wire change #2 (`git diff main..HEAD -- crates/contract/` empty; no `Cargo.toml`/
  `Cargo.lock` change), no domain-structure change #3.

**The load-bearing learning this cycle — a mechanical lint pulls *against* a prose-only secret
rule, and that tension is how the leak survived from 0004 through 0011.** The operator's root-cause
comment nailed it: the `Session` struct was introduced in 0004 (`4b9eda0`) **after** both the
`rust-standards` secret rule and the `contract::Password` redacting template already existed — so it
was a violation of a **pre-existing documented rule**, missed by the 0004 author and cold reviewer,
then carried silently through 0005/0008/0010/0011 because **cold review is diff-scoped** (pre-existing
code is out of each cycle's review scope) until 0012's reviewer flagged it. Two contributing factors:
(1) the secret rule is **prose-only**, with no clippy/lint enforcement for "bare secret reachable from
`Debug`"; (2) `[workspace.lints] rust.missing_debug_implementations = "deny"` actively pushes devs to
add `#[derive(Debug)]` to **every** public type — colliding with the secret rule, and by default the
bare derive wins. Durable fix this cycle: a **`rust-standards` callout** (home #1, on `main`) under
*Sensitive data* making the `missing_debug_implementations`-vs-secret tension explicit and naming the
resolution pattern (a redacting newtype: `contract::Password` / `tui::app::SessionToken`), framed as
a per-secret-field checklist item since cold review can't catch the pre-existing case. **A mechanical
guard remains the real durable fix** — recorded below as a recommended future Board `chore`.

Durable learnings: **one `rust-standards` addition** — the Debug-lint-vs-secret-redaction callout
(above). **No new ADR** (a `tui`-internal representation change, no contract/domain decision), **no
new crate → no new dev agent** (`SessionToken` is a module inside the existing `tui` crate, already
owned by `tui-dev`). **No new CLAUDE.md hard-constraint or gotcha** earned this cycle: the secret-leak
rule already lives in `rust-standards` (its correct home); this cycle sharpens that skill rather than
adding a cross-cutting domain rule.

**Recommended future Board item (mintable `chore`, low priority) — a mechanical secret-in-`Debug`
guard.** The prose callout is the safety net, not the fix. The durable fix is a **mechanical check**
that a bare secret cannot be reachable from a derived `Debug` (e.g. a clippy lint / custom static
check / a CI grep-and-fail over `token`/`password`/`secret`-typed bare fields on `#[derive(Debug)]`
types, or a marker-trait convention the lint keys on). This is its own scoped piece of work (likely
`platform-dev` + a tooling decision), **not** in scope for 0013 — flagged here so the orchestrator can
mint it directly. Until it exists, the `rust-standards` callout + the two redacting-newtype templates
are the guard.

**Homes.** Feature-local on the branch (home #2): the item's `## Summary` (with the coverage line),
committed on `feature/0013-session-token-debug-leak` (Board-only, code-hash unchanged → verdict
intact). Cross-cutting/derived on `main` (homes #1/#3): this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the "What
works right now" snapshot refreshed for the 0013 state), the `rust-standards` callout, the brought-
current `docs/build-plan.md`, and the regenerated `board/README.md`. **`main`'s frozen copy of
`board/features/0013-session-token-debug-leak.md` stays untouched** at the claim snapshot (`ready`)
until the human's merge. The orchestrator flips the branch status to `awaiting-merge` after this step.

## Handoff — 2026-06-25 (0012 — Profiles create/update/delete + TUI switcher; the final domain feature)

The **last domain feature** shipped: full profile management. Today's only profile surface was
`GET /api/profiles` (list) plus the register-time default-profile bootstrap; 0012 adds create,
rename, delete (with cascade) and a TUI profile-picker/switcher, governed by [ADR-0009][adr-0009]
(profile mutations, referencing ADR-0005 §2/§4/§6 — the **two new error codes** are an append-only
ADR event). Branch `feature/0012-profiles-crud-and-switcher` (code commit `e6afefd`, code-hash
`71fb7ecf327fbd42a14cb19456207885c782fe49`); reviewer **approved** + verifier **verified**, both
pinned to that hash. Stopped at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch, contract → server → tui):

- **`contract`** (`7d0979a`) — `CreateProfileRequest { name }`, `UpdateProfileRequest { name }`,
  and two **append-only** error codes `ErrorCode::ProfileNameTaken` / `ErrorCode::LastProfile`
  (`Unknown` forward-compat fallback intact). No DTO redefinition (#2).
- **`server`** (`9960653`) — `POST /api/profiles` (201), `PATCH /api/profiles/{id}` (200),
  `DELETE /api/profiles/{id}` (204), owner-scoped. Race-safe DB unique-violation →
  `409 profile_name_taken` (no TOCTOU); atomic single-statement last-profile guard →
  `409 last_profile`; delete **cascades** tasks **and** notes via FK `ON DELETE CASCADE` (no app
  fan-out, #4); unowned → `404`, blank name → `400`. Reversible `UNIQUE (user_id, name)` migration
  `20260612163050_profile_name_unique` (ordered after 0010); `.sqlx/` refreshed.
- **`tui`** (`5886060`) — `Client` create/rename/delete profile + `ClientRequest`/`Outcome` worker
  arms; `Screen::Profiles` switcher opened by `s` (Enter = pick-active; `a`/`e`/`x` =
  create/rename/delete). Switch is **client-side only** — rebinds the in-memory
  `active_profile_id`, re-scopes subsequent task/note calls, **no** server endpoint, **no**
  persistence (#1); deleting the active profile re-points to the first remaining;
  `ProfileNameTaken`/`LastProfile` inline.
- **Tests** (`e6afefd`) — contract `profile.rs` 8 / `error.rs` 16; server `profiles.rs` 20 incl.
  the headline cascade test asserting **both** task AND note gone (DB count + 404), cross-account
  same-name allowed, auth; tui `profiles.rs` 16 + `keybindings.rs` 25 (pick-active carries the new
  id with **no** switch call, inline conflict codes, in-flight/stale-drop, active-repoint). All
  gates green at `e6afefd`: `./ok.sh prepare | build | test | lint | fmt --check`.

coverage: **66.91%** line (the headline `TOTAL` from a fresh `./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree;
docker + throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly). Report-only — never a gate.

**The load-bearing learning this cycle — `./ok.sh prepare` was never self-contained, and the
permission guard surfaced the gap.** `cmd_prepare` had been bare since the first scaffold
(`cargo sqlx prepare --workspace`, no DB wiring). Every prior server cycle that refreshed `.sqlx/`
did so via an **ad-hoc out-of-band `DATABASE_URL`** pointed at some live PG — which this session's
permission guard (correctly) denied, exposing that the verb itself had never carried its own DB.
Slice 2 needed a `.sqlx/` refresh for 3 new compile-checked queries; `server-dev` **blocked rather
than improvise** (#6). The operator authorized **Option A**: `platform-dev` made `cmd_prepare`
self-contained on **`main`** (`3e0094b`) — boot the throwaway test PG → apply migrations **via the
sqlx CLI** (deliberately **not** the server binary, which would hit the offline-build circularity
on a feature branch whose `.sqlx/` is mid-refresh) → `cargo sqlx prepare` → teardown — mirroring
`cmd_test` (0003) and `cmd_coverage` (0007). Validated by a zero-`.sqlx`-diff run on `main`. This
**completes the "every DB-needing `ok.sh` verb self-boots the shared test PG" pattern** the 0007
handoff first named in `bash-standards` — `test`, `coverage`, and now `prepare` all use the one
`DATABASE_URL`/compose/`RETURN`-trap wiring. Recorded durably below (`bash-standards`).

Verdicts (both @ code-hash `71fb7ecf327fbd42a14cb19456207885c782fe49`, code commit `e6afefd`):

- **reviewer — REVIEW-STATUS: approved.** Gate clean; no contract drift (#2, append-only); all
  hard constraints hold (#1 client-side in-memory switch, #4 owner-scoped + FK cascade, #3 no
  domain structure, #5 auth unchanged); race-safety correct (DB unique-violation mapped, atomic
  last-profile guard); migration reversible, ordered after 0010; headline cascade test asserts BOTH
  children gone. No fix-now findings.
- **verifier — VERDICT: verified.** `./ok.sh up` booted clean (no cross-worktree migration-history
  conflict; all 6 migrations applied). RAN live against `localhost:8080`: create 201 / trim /
  empty→`400`; duplicate→`409 profile_name_taken` + cross-account same-name 201; rename 200,
  unowned→`404`; **cascade** delete → DB-confirmed `tasks=0, notes=0, profile=0` + HTTP 404 (#4);
  last-profile→`409 last_profile`; no cross-leak; no-token→`401`; bodies standard status +
  `{ code, message }`; OTel handler spans observed. TUI `TestBackend` suite present + green
  (ADR-0003).

Durable learnings: **one `bash-standards` addition** — the `cmd_prepare` pattern-completion (below).
**No new ADR** (ADR-0009 already on `main` with the plan), **no new crate → no new dev agent** (the
profile surface is modules inside the existing crates — `crates/contract/src/profile/`,
`crates/server/src/handlers/profiles.rs`, `crates/tui/src/app/profiles.rs`, each already owned). **No
new CLAUDE.md hard-constraint or gotcha** earned this cycle: the prepare gap is an infra/`ok.sh`
discipline (its home is `bash-standards`, not a cross-cutting domain rule), and the
cross-worktree-volume gotcha did **not** recur (a clean `./ok.sh up`).

**Homes.** Feature-local on the branch (home #2): the item's `## Summary` (with the coverage line),
committed on `feature/0012-profiles-crud-and-switcher` (`3fedcbe`; Board-only, code-hash unchanged).
Cross-cutting/derived on `main` (homes #1/#3): this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the "What works right
now" snapshot refreshed for the 0012 state), the `bash-standards` `cmd_prepare` learning, and the
regenerated `board/README.md`. The `cmd_prepare` source change itself already landed on `main`
(`3e0094b`, by `platform-dev`, mid-build). **`main`'s frozen copy of
`board/features/0012-profiles-crud-and-switcher.md` stays untouched** at the claim snapshot
(`ready`) until the human's merge. The orchestrator flips the branch status to `awaiting-merge`
after this step.

**Free pickup noted (mintable `chore`, low priority):** the reviewer flagged a pre-existing,
out-of-scope nit — `Session.token` is a bare `String` and `Session` derives `Debug`, so the raw JWT
is reachable via the derived `Debug` impl (e.g. if a `Session` is ever logged). Predates 0012 and is
unchanged here; not fixed in-cycle because it would change the code-hash and void the approved +
verified verdicts. The orchestrator may mint it as a `type: chore`, `priority: low` item carrying
just a `## Feature request` (wrap `token` in a redacting newtype, or give `Session` a manual `Debug`
that elides the token — mirroring the `contract` `Password` redacting-newtype pattern).

## Handoff — 2026-06-25 (0011 re-cycle — re-rebased onto post-0010 `main`, re-reviewed + re-verified)

The operator merged **0010 (Notes)** to `main`, then **0011 was re-rebased onto post-0010 `main`**
(`5ad5ba9`). Unlike the prior docs-only step-7 freshen, this rebase **changed code**: it pulled the
entire Notes feature into 0011's `crates/` tree, with real conflicts in the TUI (`app/mod.rs`,
`protocol.rs`, `client/mod.rs`, `client/worker.rs`, `terminal/mod.rs`, `ui/mod.rs`) and the test
helpers — exactly the files both features extended. They were resolved as a **union** preserving both
surfaces: 0011's breaking removal (`CloseTask`/`close_task`/`CloseSelected` dropped) plus
`UpdateTask`/`DeleteTask` and the Notes variants all kept; the `map_key` caption merged to carry all
keys with `BOTTOM_BAND_ROWS = 3`.

Because `./ok.sh code-hash` is a whole-`crates/`-tree digest (not per-feature), pulling Notes in
**changed 0011's code-hash** `e66426f0a6fcb9c0ba3f7e6baf1f3b606708a6cf` →
`ee5047c9abf1e4196ed1933655a61fcf41148bcb`, which per the verdict-pinning rule **voided** the prior
`approved`/`verified` verdicts — so 0011 **re-entered review + verify** even though task-mutation and
Notes never touched the same behaviour. Both **re-passed** at the new hash `ee5047c9…`: reviewer
**approved** (cold re-review confirming the union merge preserves both surfaces), verifier
**verified** (live re-boot — the earlier cross-worktree migration-history collision is gone now that
0011's tree legitimately carries the `20260612163049 notes` migration; all 8 task flows ran). Stopped
again at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on the branch, awaiting the human's merge.

coverage: **68.24% line** (62.99% region / 70.77% function), freshly measured on the merged tree —
now **reflects the Notes feature** the re-rebase pulled in (the pre-rebase 0011 snapshot was lower;
this figure matches 0010's because the tree now contains both). Report-only — never a gate.

**Durable learning recorded (the load-bearing one this re-cycle).** When two independent features
both sit at `awaiting-merge` and one merges, rebasing the second onto the new `main` pulls the merged
feature's files into the second's `crates/` tree, **changing its code-hash and voiding its
approved/verified verdicts** — forcing a re-review/re-verify on a feature that changed no behaviour
of its own. Recorded as a new CLAUDE.md gotcha (near the cross-worktree volume gotcha). **Plan for
it:**
merge parallel `awaiting-merge` features in a deliberate order and budget a re-review/re-verify pass
for the trailing one; the conflicts land in the files both features extended (enum variants, trait
methods, worker/dispatch arms, key handling, captions), resolved as a union. **No new ADR** (ADR-0008
already on `main`), **no new crate → no new dev agent**.

**Homes.** Feature-local on the branch (home #2): the refreshed `## Summary` (coverage line +
verdict-hash references updated to `ee5047c9…`), committed on `feature/0011-task-update-delete-reopen`
(`915005c`; code-hash unchanged — Board-only). Cross-cutting/derived on `main` (homes #1/#3): this
`docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the "What works right now" snapshot refreshed) and the new CLAUDE.md
gotcha, plus the regenerated `board/README.md`. **`main`'s frozen copy of
`board/features/0011-task-update-delete-reopen.md` stays untouched** at the claim snapshot until the
human's merge.

## Handoff — 2026-06-25 (0011 — task update/delete/reopen; `close` removed, breaking)

The one-way task `close` was generalized into full task **edit / toggle-done / reopen / delete**.
This is a **breaking** contract change ([ADR-0008][adr-0008-0011], referencing ADR-0005 §5/§8): the
`POST .../tasks/{id}/close` route is **removed**, not deprecated. With a single in-repo consumer (the
TUI, migrated in the same item) and ADR-0005 §8 making `contract` the compatibility authority +
forbidding URI versioning, a clean removal is the correct shape — there is no external client to keep
a deprecated route alive for. Branch `feature/0011-task-update-delete-reopen`; reviewer
**approved** + verifier **verified**, both pinned to code-hash
`e66426f0a6fcb9c0ba3f7e6baf1f3b606708a6cf` (last code
sha `6c3b987`). Stopped at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch, contract → server → tui):

- **`contract`** — `UpdateTaskRequest { title?, description?, status? }`, an all-optional partial-update
  DTO (`skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`); no `updated_at`, flat (#3).
- **`server`** — `PATCH …/tasks/{task_id}` via a single static parameterized `UPDATE … RETURNING`
  (`COALESCE`/`CASE`): `status: done` sets `closed_at`, `status: open` (reopen) clears it to null,
  absent leaves it untouched, empty patch is a 200 no-op, blank title → 400 `validation_failed`.
  `DELETE …/tasks/{task_id}` → 204, second/missing → 404. The `close_task` handler + `…/close` route
  are gone. Both routes ownership-joined (`WHERE id=$1 AND profile_id=$2`), unowned → 404 never 403
  (#4). **No migration** — the existing `tasks` table already supports the in-place update.
- **`tui`** — task list gains edit (`e`), toggle-done/reopen (`c`), delete (`x`, two-step confirm);
  all mutations chain a `ListTasks` refresh (stateless, #1); `client`/`protocol` `CloseTask` →
  `UpdateTask` plus `DeleteTask`.

coverage: **62.87%** line (the headline `TOTAL` from a fresh `./ok.sh coverage` in the worktree).
Report-only — never a gate.

**Cross-worktree infra gotcha (the load-bearing learning this cycle).** The live verifier's first run
**failed to boot the stack** — and it was **not** a 0011 defect. Concurrent feature worktrees all use
the **same docker compose project name (`deploy`)** and therefore share the **persistent named volume
`deploy_postgres-data`**. That volume still carried 0010's `notes` migration (`20260612163049`), but
0011's migration tree correctly ends at `20260612163048_timer` (0011 needs no schema change). sqlx's
strict migration-history consistency check then refused to proceed — *"migration 20260612163049 was
previously applied but is missing in the resolved migrations"* — and the `run` service, gated on the
one-shot `migrate`, never came up. Per #6 the verifier did **not** work around it (the clean fix,
`docker compose down -v`, would destroy another branch's local data). The operator authorized resetting
the `deploy_postgres-data` volume; the next `./ok.sh up` recreated it clean and the verifier re-ran
green. Recorded as a CLAUDE.md gotcha. **Recommended follow-up (a `platform-dev` concern):** give each
worktree an isolated compose project name / volume (e.g. derive `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` from the
worktree slug) so concurrent branches never share migration history — this removes the failure mode
rather than relying on an operator volume reset.

**Homes.** Feature-local on the branch (home #2): the item's `## Summary` (with the coverage line),
committed on `feature/0011-task-update-delete-reopen`. Cross-cutting/derived on `main` (homes #1/#3):
this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the "What works right now" snapshot refreshed), the new CLAUDE.md
gotcha, and the regenerated `board/README.md`. **`main`'s frozen copy of
`board/features/0011-task-update-delete-reopen.md` stays untouched** at the claim snapshot until the
human's merge. The orchestrator flips the branch status to `awaiting-merge` after the step-7 freshen.
**No new ADR** (ADR-0008 already on `main` with the plan), **no new crate → no new dev agent**.

**Free pickup noted (mintable `chore`, low priority):** the reviewer flagged `crates/tui/README.md:15`
still says "list/add/**close** tasks" — stale after the close→update/delete migration (the server
README route table was correctly updated). A doc-only fix; not touched here because it would change
the code-hash and void the approved+verified verdicts. The orchestrator may mint it as a `type: chore`,
`priority: low` item carrying just a `## Feature request` (update the line to reflect edit/toggle/delete).

## Handoff — 2026-06-24 (0010 — Notes, the final domain feature, end-to-end across all three crates)

The **last missing domain feature** shipped: Notes, a near-exact structural clone of the task
surface, governed by [ADR-0007][adr-0007] (notes wire contract — already on `main` with the plan).
Branch: `feature/0010-notes` (code sha `2a4074d` at verification; current branch HEAD after this
eng-manager step). Reviewer **approved** and verifier **verified**, both pinned to code-hash
`46c1c60f1eb3865eb127a72502982827ebb09d65` (re-confirmed equal at this step — verdicts carry
forward, no relabelling). The cycle stopped at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch, contract → server → tui per the slice order):

- **`contract`** — a new `note` module: `Note { id, title, content, created_at }`,
  `CreateNoteRequest { title, content }`, `UpdateNoteRequest { title, content }`, reusing the
  `{ code?, message }` error contract with **no** new `ErrorCode`. Flat (#3), no `updated_at`
  (editing mutates in place; only `created_at` is a timestamp, operator-locked).
- **`server`** — five CRUD routes under `/api/profiles/{id}/notes` (create 201 / list 200 bare
  array newest-first / get 200 / update 200 in-place / delete 204), every query ownership-joined
  so an unowned or missing profile/note id is `404 not_found` (never 403, #4 / ADR-0005 §4
  non-observability). Reversible migration `20260612163049_notes` (paired up/down; `ON DELETE
  CASCADE`, `(profile_id, created_at DESC)` index) + a `.sqlx/` refresh.
- **`tui`** — five `Client` trait methods + `HttpClient` impls, `ClientRequest`/`Outcome` variants
  (carrying `token` + `profile_id`) + worker arms, and a `Screen::Notes` view (list +
  create/edit/delete sub-flows) opened by `n` from the task list. Stateless (#1); no `chrono` in
  `tui` (A8 — timestamp formatting at the render seam).
- **`fix(tui)`** — a caption-layout regression the TUI suite surfaced (see learning below): adding
  `n: notes` grew `TASK_LIST_CAPTION` so the pending caption + spinner clipped the cancel
  affordance at 80×24 (ADR-0006 §8.3); the bottom band was widened to 3 rows and both captions
  re-phrased with ` | ` separators, no assertions weakened.

Tests in all three crates: `contract` note DTOs 11 (+ doctests), `server` notes integration 28
(incl. profile-scoping + auth-required per route), `tui` `TestBackend` notes suite 13 (+
rendering 11). All four gates green at branch head (`build | test | lint --all-targets |
fmt --check`).

Verdicts (both @ code-hash `46c1c60f1eb3865eb127a72502982827ebb09d65`):

- **reviewer — REVIEW-STATUS: approved.** Hard constraints clear (#1 stateless, #2 DTOs only in
  `contract`, #3 flat no-`updated_at`, #4 every query ownership-joined → 404 never 403); no new
  `ErrorCode`; migration up/down paired + cascade; the caption `fix(tui)` in-scope (ADR-0006 §8.3).
- **verifier — VERIFY-STATUS: verified.** Booted the real stack (`./ok.sh up`, docker 29.5.3);
  migration applied; flat schema confirmed (`id,profile_id,title,content,created_at`, no
  `updated_at`); the full wire surface exercised live (shapes, status codes, `{code,message}`
  contract, profile-scoping → 404, all five OTel handler spans). One stated inference: the reqwest
  `HttpClient` path verified by structural equivalence (curl drove the wire; the `tui` Client maps
  one-for-one + the 13-test suite drives the trait), not a literal live reqwest harness — not a
  coverage gap.

coverage: **68.24% line** (62.99% region, 70.77% function), the headline `TOTAL` from a fresh
`./ok.sh coverage` run in the worktree (docker + throwaway test Postgres booted cleanly — nothing
acquired, #6 intact). Up from the 0009 snapshot (66.36% line) — the notes server handlers and TUI
view land well-tested (`handlers/notes.rs` 100% line, `app/notes.rs` 90%). **Report-only — no
threshold, never a gate.**

Durable learning recorded (one, in the `tui-dev` agent): **caption width and bottom-band height
are coupled at the 80×24 test viewport.** This bit on 0008-R1 (the append-spinner work) and **again
on 0010** (adding the `n: notes` hotkey), so it earned a durable agent note rather than staying a
per-cycle surprise: growing a fixed-width caption can wrap the stable caption + appended spinner +
cancel affordance an extra line and clip it — a render regression the `TestBackend` suite catches,
not the compiler. The fix is always to budget the band row count (and pick ` | ` wrap points) in
the *same* change that grows the caption; the invariant is owned by ADR-0006 §8.3, and the
rendering code already carries inline comments naming the 80×24 boundary. No CLAUDE.md hard
constraint earned (this is a TUI-layout discipline, not a cross-cutting domain rule), no
standards-skill edit, **no new ADR** (ADR-0007 governs the contract and was already on `main`),
**no new crate → no new dev agent**.

**Homes.** Feature-local on the branch (home #2): the item's `## Summary` (with the coverage line)
and this `[eng-manager]` Log context, committed on `feature/0010-notes`. Cross-cutting/derived on
`main` (homes #1/#3): this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the "What works right now" snapshot refreshed
for the 0010 state), the `tui-dev` caption/band learning, and the regenerated `board/README.md`.
**`main`'s frozen copy of `board/features/0010-notes.md` stays untouched** at the claim snapshot
(`ready`) until the human's merge. The orchestrator flips the branch status to `awaiting-merge`
after this step.

**Free pickup noted (mintable `chore`):** none this cycle.

## Handoff — 2026-06-24 (0009 — coverage capture wired into the cycle + each Summary; chore, `main`-only)

The operator's process request — *"add the coverage run in the process, and report the code
coverage percentage in the summary of the tasks when they are awaiting merge"* — shipped as a
`main`-only governance `chore` (commit `6b6e373`, code-hash
`3fa0adefce8cd6d67ae716dae7a24ce6dbf9defd`). **No worktree was cut**: every edited file is home-#1
shared state (drive SKILL, CLAUDE.md, the eng-manager agent def) that must never ride a feature
branch, so `eng-manager` applied the edits directly on `main` and the orchestrator advanced status
in place. It ran the **lighter chore DoD** — gates green + a cold reviewer approval **attesting the
chore invariant** (code-path digest byte-identical to pre-0009 `cef68fe` ⇒ zero code delta) — and
the **live verifier pass was correctly skipped** (chore clause 4 N/A).

What shipped (three governance edits, all on `main`):

- **`drive` SKILL step 6** — step 6 now runs `./ok.sh coverage`, parses the headline workspace
  coverage %, and writes a `coverage: NN.N%` line into the item's `## Summary` (or
  `coverage: unavailable (docker)` when docker / the throwaway test Postgres cannot boot). Runs on
  **every** cycle (feature and chore); **report-only — never a gate**.
- **`CLAUDE.md` Definition of done** — a short gate-neutral note: the Summary records the coverage
  % for both `feature` and `chore`, for visibility only — not a clause, no threshold, never
  blocking; docker-unavailable becomes `unavailable (docker)` and the cycle proceeds. Consistent
  with the "How to run" `coverage` row.
- **`.claude/agents/eng-manager.md` charter** — the Summary-filling bullet now explicitly includes
  the coverage capture + `unavailable (docker)` fallback (report-only).

**This cycle dogfoods the very feature 0009 introduces.** 0009's own `## Summary` is the **first
item Summary to carry a coverage line**: `coverage: 66.36% line (61.48% region, 66.67% function)`,
the headline `TOTAL` from a fresh `./ok.sh coverage` run (docker + throwaway test Postgres booted
cleanly, same as `./ok.sh test` this cycle — nothing acquired, hard constraint #6 intact). Matches
the ~66% line / ~61% region 0007 baseline; report-only, no target to hit.

**0009 depended on 0007** (the `./ok.sh coverage` verb), which **merged first** — 0009 consumes
that verb and could not start until it landed on `main` (`grep -c cmd_coverage ok.sh` == 2).

Durable learnings:

- **`drive` SKILL + `git-standards` (reinforcing learned 0003/0004).** The
  `noreply@anthropic.com`-in-a-dispatch-prompt failure surfaced **again** on 0009: the dispatch
  prompt hardcoded `Co-authored-by: … <noreply@anthropic.com>`, corrected to the
  `*@organized-koala.local` form per git-standards (the footer identity is owned by that skill,
  never copied from a prompt; `<noreply@anthropic.com>` is never correct in this repo). Because
  this is now a **third recurrence**, the durable fix moved to the *dispatcher* side: a new
  **"Dispatch discipline"** note in `drive`'s Procedure preamble — never write a `Co-authored-by:`
  line into a dispatch prompt; state the committing agent's role and let `git-standards` supply the
  trailer — plus a cross-referencing one-liner appended to `git-standards`. The agent-side rule was
  already correct; the gap was that prompts kept injecting the wrong trailer, so the prevention
  belongs where the prompt is authored.
- **No new ADR, no new crate, no new dev agent, no new CLAUDE.md hard-constraint.** A chore makes no
  contract/domain decision; the coverage metric is already operator-sanctioned (0007) and stays
  report-only. The three-home model, chore DoD, scope guard, and verdict-pinning all behaved as
  written.

Process note worth keeping (not an edit): a `main`-only governance chore has **no worktree and no
branch**, so step 6's "coverage line is committed on the branch (home #2)" guidance resolves to
"on `main`" for this item — the Summary lives on `main` alongside the rest of the change. The
SKILL/CLAUDE.md wording already states this explicitly, so it needed no correction; recorded here
as the worked example of the `main`-only path through the new step-6 rule.

**Homes.** Everything is on `main` (this is a `main`-only item): the three governance edits
(`6b6e373`), this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the "What works right now" snapshot refreshed for the
0009 state), the `drive`/`git-standards` dispatch-discipline edits, the item's `## Summary`
(home 1 for a `main`-only item — there is no branch), and the regenerated `board/README.md` (home 3).
`branch: null` / `worktree: null` stay. The orchestrator flips 0009 to `awaiting-merge` in place on
`main` after this step.

**Free pickup noted (mintable `chore`):** none this cycle.

## Handoff — 2026-06-23 (0007 — report-only `./ok.sh coverage` verb; chore, lighter DoD)

The operator-sanctioned coverage follow-up (captured in the 2026-06-12 0003 handoff, item #2,
and carried on the dashboard as the "sanctioned follow-up" note) shipped as a `chore`. Branch:
`feature/0007-ok-coverage-verb` (code sha `e65a097`, code-hash
`3fa0adefce8cd6d67ae716dae7a24ce6dbf9defd`). It ran the **lighter chore DoD** — gates green + a
cold reviewer approval attesting the chore invariant — and the **live `verifier` pass was
correctly skipped** (a chore changes no behaviour/wire/API, so there is nothing for a live boot
to exercise). The cycle stopped at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on the branch.

What shipped (`ok.sh` only, on the branch):

- **A `coverage` verb** — `cmd_coverage` + a `coverage)` case branch + a no-arg usage/help line.
  It runs `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only "$@"` (extra ARGS pass through) and
  **mirrors `cmd_test`'s live-DB wiring verbatim**: honour a caller-supplied `DATABASE_URL`, else
  boot the throwaway test Postgres via the test compose file and tear it down on a `RETURN` trap.
- **Report-only, no gate.** Prints a per-file table + a `TOTAL` line and exits 0 regardless of
  the number; **no threshold**, not wired into any Definition-of-done clause. This was the
  operator-sanctioned shape: coverage made *visible* without becoming a brittle pass/fail bar.
- **Coverage baseline at implementation time:** ~66% line / ~66% function / ~61% region
  (`TOTAL` line reported 61.48% region / 66.36% line). Captured here as a reference point, not a
  bar — there is no target to hit.
- **Chore invariant held.** No crate source, no behaviour, no `contract`/wire (#2), no
  domain-structure (#3) change — the diff is `ok.sh` (+31) plus the Board file. `cargo-llvm-cov`
  0.8.7 was already present and operator-sanctioned (hard constraint #6) — nothing acquired.

Verdict (chore track): **reviewer REVIEW-STATUS approved** @ code-hash
`3fa0adefce8cd6d67ae716dae7a24ce6dbf9defd` (commit `c4387b7`, for reference). Gates green
(`fmt --check` / `lint` / `test`); the **chore invariant is explicitly attested** (no behaviour,
no `contract`/wire, no domain-structure change); the verb is report-only. The code-hash is
byte-identical to the last-merged head, corroborating the tooling-only scope. No live verifier
pass (chore clause 4 skipped).

Durable learning: one small `bash-standards` addition (learned 0007) — *a report-only tooling
verb reuses the shared live-DB wiring (the `cmd_test` `DATABASE_URL`/compose/`RETURN`-trap
pattern) rather than re-deriving it, and stays honest by exiting 0 regardless of the metric; a
verb that can fail the build on a value is a gate, not a report.* No new ADR (a chore makes no
contract/domain decision), no new crate → no new dev agent, no `CLAUDE.md` hard-constraint
addition beyond documenting the verb in the "How to run" table.

**Homes.** Cross-cutting/derived on `main` (homes #1/#3): the `CLAUDE.md` "How to run" `coverage`
row, this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the "What works right now" snapshot refreshed for the 0007
state), the `bash-standards` learning, and the regenerated `board/README.md`. **Feature-local on
the branch (home #2):** only the item's `## Summary` (and its Log entries/verdict, already
committed on the branch). `main`'s frozen copy of `board/features/0007-ok-coverage-verb.md` stays
untouched at the claim snapshot (`ready`) until the human's merge.

**Free pickup noted (mintable `chore`):** none this cycle.

## Handoff — 2026-06-23 (0008-R1 — feedback re-entry: Pomodoro becomes a global widget; TUI-only)

**Feedback re-entry, not a fresh feature — the first re-entry on an item that had already reached
`awaiting-merge`.** 0008 (the account-global Pomodoro timer) was at `awaiting-merge` (verified
code-hash `708ee8d0…`) when the operator authored two `[human]` UI-feedback lines in its Log. The
cycle re-entered (drive step 0 feedback sweep), `architect` triaged, the work ran forward TUI-only,
and the item is back at the AI-terminal state on its branch. Branch: `feature/0008-pomodoro-timer`
(source `97b2b32`, tests `67e40af`; current HEAD `7ea1292` after this eng-manager step). Both
`[human]` boxes are now `[x]`.

The two feedback items:

- **suggestion(ui) — no dedicated timer page; make it an always-visible global widget.** The timer
  is a global concept, so it should be visible across pages (bottom-right), `p` to start/stop, and
  listed in the bottom-left help caption.
- **issue(ui) — flicker + over-frequent refresh.** The "(working…)" text replacing the hotkey
  caption every coarse poll causes flicker; append a spinner to the end instead, and check the
  session ~1/min rather than ~5 s.

What changed (TUI-only, on the branch):

- **ADR amendment first, on `main`.** Because this is scope/approach feedback, `architect` amended
  **[ADR-0006][adr-0006] §8** (commit `af582e6` on `main`) before re-implementation — §8.1 global
  widget (not a `Screen`), §8.2 global `p` toggle + help-caption entry, §8.3 append-spinner (not
  caption-replacement), §8.4 ~1-min coarse cadence. **ADR-0002 (timer authority/render model) is
  unchanged** — the server still owns the countdown; the TUI still renders from `ends_at` +
  `server_now` + a monotonic `Instant`. The branch was rebased onto `af582e6` before `tui-dev`
  cited §8.
- **Source (`tui-dev`, `97b2b32`).** Removed `Screen::Timer` and its `t`/`Esc` navigation; promoted
  the timer's transient render state to an app-level `app::timer::Timer` field rendered bottom-right
  on every post-auth screen (auth/offline excluded). Added `Event::ToggleTimer` mapped to `p`
  (resolves to start when idle/completed, stop when running, stamping the timer's own in-flight
  marker independent of the screen marker); `p` + `d: set duration` added to the bottom-left
  caption; `p`/`d` suppressed while a text-entry sub-flow owns keystrokes. Replaced `working_hint`
  (caption substitution) with `caption_with_spinner` that **appends** a trailing spinner + "Esc to
  cancel" to the stable caption on every screen. Raised `TIMER_REFRESH_TICKS` 63 → **750** (~1 min);
  the refresh + initial load now fire on any post-auth screen. **No `contract`/protocol/client/
  worker shape changed** — the existing timer wire/protocol is reused verbatim; account-global
  preserved (no `profile_id`).
- **Tests (`tester`, `67e40af`).** Adapted the `TestBackend`/core suite to the global-widget model
  (`map_key` now takes `editing_duration: bool`; the timer loads off edge hooks, not an `Event`) and
  extended coverage to the re-entry acceptance criteria by name: global widget render, `p`
  start/stop/when-completed, second-`p`-while-pending no-op, append-spinner-no-flicker regression
  guard, `p` suppressed-while-editing, `t`-opens-nothing regression guard, coarse-refresh picks up
  the server verdict, account-global call-shape sweep. Counts: tui keybindings 19 / rendering 11 /
  timer 17 / flows 9 / in_flight 5 / error_branches 10; full workspace green.

Verdicts (both pinned to code-hash `3fa0adefce8cd6d67ae716dae7a24ce6dbf9defd`; the original 0008
`708ee8d0…` verdicts were **voided** when the re-entry moved the code-tree):

- **Reviewer: REVIEW-STATUS approved** (`67e40af`). Gates green; **#1** holds (app-level `Timer` is
  transient render state, no stored remaining-seconds); **#2** holds and is **byte-identical** —
  `git diff` over `crates/contract` + `crates/server` + the `tui` protocol/client is empty (this
  bounds the verifier to the TUI surface); **#4** holds (no `profile_id`); ADR-0006 §8 fidelity
  confirmed. No blocking findings, no out-of-scope nits worth a chore.
- **Verifier: VERIFY-STATUS verified** (`09470e9`). Independently confirmed the #2 byte-identity
  (full delta confined to `crates/tui/src/{app,terminal,ui}` + `crates/tui/tests/**` + the Board
  file). Docker present + sanctioned (installed nothing, as in the original pass), so the live wire
  pass was re-performed, not deferred: `./ok.sh up`, live `GET/PUT /api/timer/config`, session
  start/stop, error contract `{code,message}`, OTel spans on all five handlers; `./ok.sh down`
  clean. The `TestBackend` suite asserts the re-entry behaviour by name.

Durable learnings: **none earned a durable `CLAUDE.md`/standards-skill edit.** The candidate was
this being **the first feedback re-entry on an already-`awaiting-merge` item** — but the mechanics
played out *exactly* as the existing CLAUDE.md "Feedback re-entry" + "Verdict pinning" + three-home
text already prescribes, with no ambiguity to resolve: the unchecked `[human]` box was the only
re-entry signal; the scope/approach feedback required an ADR amendment, which (as home #1
cross-cutting state) landed on `main` first; the branch was rebased onto it; the item dropped
`awaiting-merge` → `working`; the prior `approved`/`verified` verdicts were void **because the
code-tree hash moved** (`708ee8d0…` → `3fa0adef…`, not because shas changed); and the full feature
track re-ran (build → review → verify) on the new tree. That is the written rule exercised
faithfully, not a gap in it — so it is recorded here as the worked example rather than manufactured
into a new gotcha. One observation worth keeping (not an edit): **an ADR *amendment* is home #1
just like a new ADR** — it must land on `main` before the branch can cite it, and the code-hash
movement it implies is what voids the prior verdicts; the re-entry confirmed both halves hold for
an amendment, not only a fresh ADR. No new `docs-/bash-/coding-/git-standards` edit, no new ADR
beyond the §8 amendment, no new crate → no new dev agent.

**Homes.** Cross-cutting/derived on `main` (homes #1/#3): this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the "What
works right now" snapshot refreshed for the 0008 end state), and the regenerated `board/README.md`.
The ADR-0006 §8 amendment + decisions-index row already landed on `main` (`af582e6`, by
`architect`). **Feature-local on the branch (home #2):** the item's updated `## Summary`, the
`[eng-manager]` Log entry, and the two `[x]`-checked `[human]` feedback boxes. The orchestrator
flips the branch status back to `awaiting-merge` after this; **`main`'s frozen copy of
`board/features/0008-pomodoro-timer.md` stays untouched** at the claim snapshot until the human's
merge.

## Handoff — 2026-06-23 (0008 — account-global Pomodoro focus timer, end-to-end across all three crates)

Branch: `feature/0008-pomodoro-timer` (last code sha `fc894ce`, code-hash
`708ee8d0085ce9b3af68eb7e1b76dbe56a6185da`). The **first feature of the Focus phase** — the
Pomodoro timer end-to-end, implementing [ADR-0002][adr-0002] (timer authority) without reopening
or amending it. The cycle ran build → cold review → live verify and stopped at the AI-terminal
`awaiting-merge` on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch):

- **`contract` — a new `timer` module.** `TimerConfig { duration_minutes }`,
  `UpdateTimerConfigRequest { duration_minutes }`, and a tagged `TimerSession` enum
  (`#[serde(tag = "state", rename_all = "lowercase")]`) with `Idle` / `Running` / `Completed`;
  the running/completed variants carry `started_at`, `ends_at`, `duration_minutes`, and
  `server_now`. Datetimes serialize RFC 3339 `Z` exactly as `Task::created_at`; the established
  derive/rustdoc/doctest layout is followed; the three items are re-exported from `lib.rs`. No new
  `ErrorCode`, no secrets, nothing beyond the ADR-0002 shapes (#3 flat).
- **`server` — five account-global endpoints + a reversible migration.** All keyed on
  `AuthUser.user_id` with **no `profile_id` in any path** (#4 / ADR-0002 §5): `GET`/`PUT
  /api/timer/config` (default 30 lazily, upsert, `[1, 1440]` bound → `400 ValidationFailed`
  outside, reusing the `{ code?, message }` contract, no new `ErrorCode`); `GET
  /api/timer/session` (idle / running / completed, completion decided read-time when `server_now
  >= ends_at`); `POST /api/timer/session/start` (snapshots the configured duration;
  start-while-active replaces — A5); `POST /api/timer/session/stop` (clears the active row,
  idempotent when idle). Migration `20260612163048_timer.{up,down}.sql` creates `timer_configs` +
  `timer_sessions`, both `user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY` (schema-enforced at-most-one config / one
  active session per account); `ends_at` is **derived** (`started_at + duration_minutes`), never
  stored; the `down` drops both tables. `#[tracing::instrument]` spans on every handler;
  `i32`↔`u32` at the DB boundary via `try_from`, never `as`. `.sqlx/` refreshed against the
  sanctioned project test Postgres.
- **`tui` — a focus/timer view with a render-only countdown.** `Screen::Timer`, reachable with
  `t` from the task list (`s` start, `x` stop, `d` set duration, `r` refresh, `Esc` back). The
  live `MM:SS` countdown is **render-only** (#1-safe): **no** authoritative remaining-seconds
  integer is stored — the label is recomputed every ~80 ms render tick as `ends_at` minus
  `(server_now + elapsed_since_response)`, where `elapsed_since_response` comes from a monotonic
  `Instant` captured when the response landed. Coarse session re-reads are ~5 s (A3) — never
  per-second, no tick stream (stays inside [ADR-0006][adr-0006]). On reaching `00:00` locally it
  shows "Completed (awaiting server confirmation)" until the server's authoritative `Completed`
  verdict arrives.
- **Tests (tester).** `contract` 19 (round-trip, tagged-enum wire shape, `Z` offsets), server 21
  `#[sqlx::test]` (config default/persist/bounds, start→running with consistent instants, stop,
  start-replaces-active, account-global with two accounts, auth-required), tui 14 `TestBackend` +
  5 keybinding (navigation, running countdown rendered via `countdown_label`, stop, set-duration +
  inline validation, completed render, in-flight spinner, cancel/stale-id drop, account-global /
  profile-switch-unchanged). The one positive completion-at-`ends_at` transition is deliberately
  left to the live verifier (forcing `now >= ends_at` would need a real ~60 s sleep the suite
  avoids — noted inline in `shortest_session_reads_running_not_completed`).

Verdicts (both pinned to code-hash `708ee8d0085ce9b3af68eb7e1b76dbe56a6185da`, sha `fc894ce`):

- **Reviewer: REVIEW-STATUS approved.** Gates green (contract 19 / server 21 / tui 14 + 5
  keybinding, lint `--all-targets` clean, fmt clean). Risk-surface all HOLD: **#1** stateless
  (countdown recomputed each draw, nothing persisted); **#4 / ADR-0002 §5** account-global (the
  routes and client methods key on `user_id`, tables `user_id PRIMARY KEY`); **#3** flat
  (duration the only knob, no pause); **#2 / ADR-0002** contract is single source of truth, no
  new/amended ADR; reversible migration with `ends_at` derived; `{ code?, message }` reused, no new
  `ErrorCode`; no `as` at the DB boundary; spans on all five handlers; the three `#[allow]` are the
  sanctioned test-only exception.
- **Verifier: VERIFY-STATUS verified.** Live against `./ok.sh up` (docker present, migrate
  one-shot exited 0, both tables created). **Completion DIRECTLY OBSERVED** (not inferred): a
  1-min session polled every 5 s flipped running→`completed` when `server_now >= ends_at`; the row
  was kept (`count=1`, re-read still `completed`) until `stop` (`count=0`, idle). **Persistence
  across `docker compose restart server`**: config + running session survived (only `server_now`
  advanced) → state lives in Postgres. Account-global (no `profile_id`; second account
  independent), auth (no-bearer → `401 unauthenticated`), and OTel spans for all five handlers
  with `code.namespace: server::handlers::timer` + the `user_id` attribute. ADR-0003 handshake:
  the `TestBackend` suite present + green. Stack torn down cleanly.

Durable learnings captured this cycle: **none earned a durable `CLAUDE.md`/standards-skill
edit.** The candidate considered was the **render-only countdown pattern** — a #1-safe
live-updating-but-server-authoritative value computed each draw from a server-provided absolute
instant (`ends_at` + `server_now`) plus a monotonic `Instant`, never stored as a counter. It is a
clean, reusable idiom, but it does **not** generalize beyond what is already written: it is a
direct specialization of [ADR-0006][adr-0006] §5 (transient process-lifetime render state, the
same category as the in-flight spinner marker), the #1 statelessness invariant, and the
pure-core/effectful-shell rule already in `rust-standards` (learned 0004/0005). Manufacturing a
new skill entry would duplicate those, so the pattern is recorded **here** as the worked example
rather than promoted into a standard. No new `CLAUDE.md` gotcha (no recurring miss surfaced — the
three-home model, contract-frozen boundary #2, statelessness #1, and account-global #4 all held
cleanly), no `docs-/bash-/coding-/git-standards` edit, no new ADR (inside ADR-0002/0003/0006).

**No new crate** → no new dev agent: the timer is a module *inside* the existing crates
(`crates/contract/src/timer/`, `crates/server/src/handlers/timer.rs`, `crates/tui/src/app/timer.rs`),
each already owned by `contract-owner` / `server-dev` / `tui-dev`. Confirmed, not skipped.

**Free pickup spotted (mintable `chore` for a future cycle):** the `tui` timer-edit sub-flow
mirrors the existing `AddTaskState` text-entry pattern closely enough that the two could share a
small `TextEntryState` helper — a pure refactor with no behaviour / contract / domain change. Not
filed here (recorded so the orchestrator can mint it directly if desired); low priority.

**Homes.** Cross-cutting/derived on `main` (homes #1/#3): this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the
"What works right now" snapshot refreshed), `docs/build-plan.md`, and the regenerated
`board/README.md`. **Feature-local on the branch (home #2):** the item's `## Summary` + the
`[eng-manager]` Log entry. The orchestrator advances the branch status to `awaiting-merge` after
this; **`main`'s frozen copy of `board/features/0008-pomodoro-timer.md` is left untouched** at the
claim snapshot until the human's merge.

## Handoff — 2026-06-23 (0006 — inaugural `chore`: stale `tui/src/main.rs` doc comment fixed)

Branch: `feature/0006-tui-mainrs-stale-doccomment` (last code sha `e218f73`, code-hash
`401ad3de59c4cc7e33c3ebf8308c171d80659e4e`). **The first `chore` through the pipeline** — the
new lightweight item type (introduced as a learned-0005 governance follow-up) made its first
real trip end-to-end. The cycle ran mint → claim → build → cold review → (verify skipped) and
stopped at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch):

- **Comment-only fix.** The module doc comment at `crates/tui/src/main.rs:1` described an
  *"initial health probe so an unreachable server is reported up front"* — behaviour 0005
  removed when it reshaped the entrypoint to ADR-0006 Model A. The comment was rewritten to
  describe the actual entrypoint: resolve base URL → build the `reqwest` client → **spawn the
  worker thread that owns it** → hand control to the interactive loop, where the UI thread
  drives the pure `tui::app::App` core and never blocks on I/O. The `anyhow`
  error-propagation note was kept. The diff vs `main` is the `//!` block only.
- **Chore invariant held.** No code path, signature, behaviour, `contract`/wire (#2), or
  domain-structure (#3) change.

Verdict (chore track):

- **Reviewer: REVIEW-STATUS approved** pinned to code-hash
  `401ad3de59c4cc7e33c3ebf8308c171d80659e4e` (sha `5b5c788`). The cold pass verified the new
  comment line-by-line against `main()` (no health probe; worker-spawn / pure-`App` /
  `terminal::run` / `anyhow`), gates green, and — as the strengthened chore-DoD clause 6
  requires — **explicitly attested the chore invariant** (no behaviour, no contract/wire, no
  domain-structure change; comment-only).
- **Verifier: SKIPPED (clause 4 N/A).** Per the chore track, the live boot was not run — a
  comment-only change has nothing new to exercise, and the cold reviewer is the safety net in
  its place.

The chore lane worked exactly as designed: mint-without-`architect`-plan → claim →
single-agent build → invariant-attesting cold review → live verify skipped → `awaiting-merge`.
The 0005 handoff's **"free pickup" prose is now resolved** — it was tracked as `0006` and has
flowed to terminal.

Durable learnings: **none earned a durable edit.** The chore machinery (DoD, scope guard,
three-home model, verdict pinning) was freshly exercised and behaved as written — no clause
was ambiguous, the mint-without-plan path was unambiguous, and verdict pinning to the
code-tree hash held (the branch was already current on `main`, code-hash unchanged, so
step-7 was a no-op freshen). No `CLAUDE.md` gotcha, no standards-skill edit, no agent edit,
no new ADR, no new crate. Recording explicitly rather than inventing churn: **the first chore
needed zero process correction.** One observation worth keeping (not an edit): the chore lane's
value is precisely that a one-line doc fix no longer has to masquerade as a full `feature`
cycle — the thing it was created to fix.

**Homes.** Cross-cutting/derived on `main` (homes #1/#3): this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the
"What works right now" snapshot refreshed), `docs/build-plan.md`, and the regenerated
`board/README.md`. **Feature-local on the branch (home #2):** the item's `## Summary`. The
orchestrator advances the branch status to `awaiting-merge` after this; **`main`'s frozen copy
of `board/features/0006-tui-mainrs-stale-doccomment.md` is left untouched** at the claim
snapshot until the human's merge.

## Handoff — 2026-06-22 (0005 — TUI responsive (non-blocking) event loop + `tui::app` reorg)

Branch: `feature/0005-tui-responsive-event-loop` (last code sha `a4f99fd`, code-hash
`bc89672d4be5cdecd0bb54b340a24a5b8741cf21`). The first item past the foundational slice: it
resolves 0004's re-homed responsiveness feedback (*"the TUI freezes during every HTTP
request"*) and folds in the requested `tui::app` submodule reorg (both restructure the same
module). The cycle ran build → review → verify and stopped at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge`
on the branch. **TUI-only — `crates/contract` and `crates/server` are byte-identical to base
`f0204fd`; no wire change, no new ADR beyond 0006.**

What shipped (on the branch):

- **Responsive UI per [ADR-0006][adr-0006] Model A** — synchronous `Client` on a worker thread,
  `std::sync::mpsc` request/response, a polled render loop, **no `tokio`/async runtime**. The UI
  thread never blocks on IO; a spinner animates and Esc(cancel)/Ctrl+C,`q`(quit) stay live in
  flight. `client/worker.rs` is a single thread owning the real `HttpClient`, mapping a
  `ClientRequest` → `Outcome` over two `mpsc` channels (no new dep). `terminal::run` is now a
  poll loop: `event::poll(80ms)` for input + `try_recv` response drain + per-tick redraw. A 30s
  `reqwest` timeout bounds an abandoned request (the `Client` trait is unchanged). `main.rs`
  spawns the worker and passes the channels in.
- **Client-free pure core.** The `App<C>` generic is gone. The core is two pure seams:
  `handle_event(Event) -> Option<Dispatch>` and `apply_response(ClientResponse) ->
  Option<Dispatch>` (chaining follow-ups — post-auth profile→task load, post-create refresh).
  Error-code branching is preserved unchanged and routes async-arriving responses through the
  same handlers.
- **One-in-flight + cancel.** Each screen carries a transient `pending: Option<RequestId>`;
  while set, request-triggering events are no-ops, `Cancel`/`Quit` stay live. Cancel is
  user-perceived — the screen leaves the in-flight state at once and a superseded response is
  dropped by `RequestId`-mismatch in `apply_response`; the worker is not force-killed.
- **`tui::app` reorg.** `app/mod.rs` keeps `App`/`Screen`/`Session`/`Event` + the
  `handle_event`/`apply_response` wiring; `app/protocol.rs` holds the pure
  `ClientRequest`/`ClientResponse`/`Outcome`/`RequestId`/`Dispatch` types; feature submodules
  `auth.rs`/`task_add.rs`/`task_list.rs` each own their screen state and handlers.
- **Tests (tester).** Added a synchronous request executor to `tests/common/mod.rs`
  (`execute`/`drive`/`submit`) — the test-side analogue of the worker thread: it maps a
  `Dispatch`'s `ClientRequest` through the `FakeClient` (the sole external-service mock) to a
  `ClientResponse` and feeds it back into `apply_response`, looping on chained follow-ups until
  the flow settles. No internal collaborator is mocked. The `TestBackend` suite (ADR-0003 layer
  2) is green and extended for in-flight render/no-op, cancel + stale-`RequestId` drop,
  at-most-one-chained-request, and Esc→Cancel/Ctrl+C→Quit while pending (tui: flows 9,
  error_branches 10, in_flight 5, keybindings 13, rendering 11).

Verdicts (both pinned to code-hash `bc89672d4be5cdecd0bb54b340a24a5b8741cf21`):

- **Reviewer: REVIEW-STATUS approved.** Gates green; `handle_event`/`apply_response` pure,
  `App<C>` gone; one-in-flight invariant holds; stale/superseded `RequestId`-mismatch drop
  correct; error-code branching preserved; `contract` diff empty; no tokio/async
  (`reqwest::blocking` + `std::thread` + `std::mpsc`); 30s timeout + clean worker teardown; no
  secret-leak path; tests are public-API with only the `Client` trait mocked. One non-blocking,
  **pre-existing** nit: a stale doc comment at `main.rs:4` (about an initial health probe —
  already stale at base `f0204fd`, out of scope here; **flagged for opportunistic cleanup in a
  future TUI-touching cycle**).
- **Verifier: VERIFY-STATUS verified.** Confirmed `crates/server`+`crates/contract` diff vs
  `f0204fd` empty. Live over `./ok.sh up` (Docker 29.5.3 + Compose; postgres → migrate one-shot
  → server → otel-collector): register/login, `GET /api/profiles`, task create/list/close, the
  `{code,message}` error contract with correct statuses, two-user profile-scoping isolation (no
  cross-profile read/write, 404 no existence leak), OTel server spans for every client call.
  ADR-0003 delegation handshake: `TestBackend` suites present + green. Inferred (code-read):
  that `HttpClient` issues exactly those requests — the standard ADR-0003 split (interactive TUI
  owned by the green `TestBackend` suite).

Durable learnings captured this cycle (each to the smallest right home, all on `main`):

- **rust-standards + tester agent — the worker-analogue synchronous test executor is the
  sanctioned way to test a pure `handle_event`/`apply_response` seam without async.** When the
  effectful shell is a worker thread + channels (ADR-0006 Model A), the test harness mirrors it
  with a small synchronous executor that maps each emitted `ClientRequest` through the injected
  fake `Client` and feeds the `ClientResponse` back into `apply_response`, looping on chained
  follow-ups. This drives the two-step seam end-to-end with the only mock being the sanctioned
  external-service trait — no internal collaborator, no async runtime. Recorded as the general
  pattern in `rust-standards` and as front-of-mind tester guidance.

Deliberately **skipped** (did not earn a durable edit): **no `CLAUDE.md` gotcha** — this cycle
hit no new recurring miss. The three-home model, the contract-frozen boundary (#2), and
statelessness (#1) all held cleanly, and the pure-core/effectful-shell rule (the executor's
foundation) already lives in `rust-standards`. No `docs-standards`/`bash-standards`/
`coding-standards`/`git-standards` change — nothing new surfaced there. **No new crate** → no
new dev agent; `tui-dev` already owns `crates/tui`. No new ADR — inside ADR-0006/ADR-0003.

Next cycle should know:

- **The poll-loop redraw path is a new candidate trigger for `docs/manual-smoke.md`.** Spinner
  repaint and terminal raw-mode teardown are invisible to `TestBackend` (accepted residual risk
  per ADR-0003 §3); when the manual-smoke checklist is authored, add a "request in flight →
  spinner animates, Esc cancels, terminal restores cleanly on quit" item.
  **✓ Resolved `4318d65`** — the checklist already existed; the in-flight item + a poll-loop-path
  trigger were added to `docs/manual-smoke.md` directly (docs-only, main-side, no cycle).
- The **`main.rs:4` stale doc comment** (pre-existing health-probe nit) is a free pickup for the
  next `tui-dev` touch.
  **✓ Resolved** — filed and run as Board chore `0006` (the inaugural `chore`); the comment now
  describes the ADR-0006 worker/pure-`App` entrypoint. Reviewed (chore invariant attested) at
  `awaiting-merge`; see the 0006 handoff entry above.
- Still pending from earlier cycles (not lost): the operator-sanctioned reported-only `./ok.sh
  coverage` verb over `cargo-llvm-cov` (no hard threshold) — `architect` to plan as a `main`-side
  item; and the deferred TUI backlog (profile-switch UX, task edit/delete, Notes, Pomodoro gated
  on ADR-0002, TUI-side OTel).

**Homes.** Cross-cutting edits on `main` (homes #1/#3): this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the
"What works right now" snapshot refreshed), the `rust-standards`/`tester` learning,
`docs/build-plan.md`, and the regenerated `board/README.md`. **Feature-local on the branch
(home #2):** the item's `## Summary`. The orchestrator advances the branch status to
`awaiting-merge` after this; **`main`'s frozen copy of
`board/features/0005-tui-responsive-event-loop.md` is left untouched** at the claim snapshot
until the human's merge.

## Handoff — 2026-06-18 (0004 — TUI: register/login + profile + task add/list/close; slice 0001 closes)

Branch: `feature/0004-tui-foundational` (last code sha `8fb0505`). Slice 3 of 3 of the 0001
umbrella — the TUI side of the tracer bullet, closing the loop TUI ↔ `contract` ↔ server ↔
Postgres. The cycle ran build → review → verify and stopped at the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge`
on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch):

- **`crates/tui`** (binary `organized-koala`, lib+bin split) — `ratatui` 0.29, `crossterm`
  0.28, blocking `reqwest` 0.12 (rustls). The crate was **auto-discovered** by the existing
  `members = ["crates/*"]` glob; **no root `Cargo.toml` edit** was needed.
- **`src/client/`** — a `Client` trait over health/register/login/list-profiles/list-tasks/
  create-task/close-task, every method typed on `contract` DTOs (no local wire types —
  hard-constraint #2). The `reqwest` impl is `HttpClient`; the standard `ErrorBody`
  (code + message) maps to a typed `ClientError` (`Api` preserving the `ErrorCode` for
  branching; `Offline` for any transport failure or unintelligible body).
- **`src/app/`** — a **pure** screen state machine (`Auth` → `TaskList`, plus a blocking
  `Offline` screen) advanced by `App::handle_event` over a transport-agnostic `Event` enum,
  with the `Client` injected. Auth: login (identifier + password) and register (username,
  email, password, profile-name); on success fetches `GET /api/profiles`, auto-selects the
  first profile (per the plan's single-profile Assumption), loads its task list. Task list:
  newest-first with done/undone markers, add-task sub-flow (Title + Description), mark-done
  sends `…/close` and replaces the row from the server response, refresh re-fetches.
  Error-code branching per ADR-0005: `unauthenticated` drops the in-memory session → login;
  `validation_failed`/other `Api` errors surface inline; transport failure → blocking offline
  screen with a manual retry. **JWT + active profile id live in process memory only**
  (hard-constraint #1; no on-disk/cross-run state).
- **`src/ui/`** pure draw fns; **`src/terminal/`** the crossterm driver with a pure `map_key`
  and a raw-mode guard restoring the terminal on drop.
- **Keybindings (now pinned by tests):** `Esc`/`Ctrl+C` quit (`Esc` = cancel in the add-task
  sub-flow); `Enter` submit; `Tab`/`Down` next, `Shift+Tab`/`Up` prev; `Backspace`; auth `F2`
  toggles login/register; task-list `a` add / `c` mark-done / `r` refresh / `q` quit; offline
  `r` retry; printable keys typed literally in text-entry contexts.
- **Tests (tester):** 35 `TestBackend` tests under `crates/tui/tests/` (the only mock a held,
  recording fake `Client` — ADR-0003 layer 2, no binary, no live DB): `keybindings.rs` (11)
  pinning the whole `map_key` contract incl. context-sensitivity, `rendering.rs` (7)
  buffer-snapshotting auth/task-list/add-task/offline (masked password — plaintext never
  rendered), `error_branches.rs` (9) driving the ADR-0005 `code` branches, `flows.rs` (8)
  the login/register→profile→list sequence, add-task, mark-done, and statelessness.

Verdicts:

- **Reviewer: REVIEW-STATUS approved `8fb0505`** — all four gates green at HEAD; hard-constraints
  #1/#2 held (no local DTOs; no persistence/file-IO; offline path fabricates no cached data),
  the ADR-0005 error contract wired+tested, the layer-2 `TestBackend` suite present and green,
  no contract/migration/shared-state drift, `#[allow]` audit clean. **No fix-now findings.** One
  non-blocking nit: the orchestrator's board-claim commit `846ba2a` used a
  `noreply@anthropic.com` co-author trailer instead of the project form (board-only, outside
  reviewed code) — now closed durably in `git-standards` (see learnings below).
- **Verifier: VERIFY-STATUS verified `8fb0505`** — capabilities present (Docker 29.5.3, Compose
  v5.1.4), **no gap**. Booted `./ok.sh up` in the worktree and exercised the live reqwest client
  path (ADR-0003 layer 1): every endpoint the `Client` consumes round-tripped with `contract`-
  matching shapes (`register` 201, `login` 200, `GET /api/profiles` 200, task list/create/close
  open→done with `closed_at` set); error contract verified live with exact wire strings
  (`unauthenticated`/`invalid_credentials` 401, `username_taken`/`email_taken` 409,
  `validation_failed` 400, `not_found` 404); profile-scoping (#4) with a second account → 404 no
  leak; persistence across a server restart; OTel spans received end-to-end by the collector. The
  layer-2 `TestBackend` suite confirmed green under `./ok.sh test`. Only un-driven items
  (neither a blocker): interactive crossterm on a real TTY (routed to the ungated
  `docs/manual-smoke.md` check per ADR-0003 §3) and the out-of-scope timer endpoint.

No contract change, no migration, no new ADR (TUI-only, inside the frozen ADR-0005 wire format
and ADR-0003 verification routing). **No new crate-dev agent** — `tui-dev` already owns
`crates/tui`.

Durable learnings captured this cycle (each to the smallest right home, all on `main`):

- **rust-standards + tui-dev agent — separate the pure core from the effectful shell to make an
  IO/interactive surface testable.** The whole TUI surface was `TestBackend`-driveable with no
  live server and no TTY because the crate is a pure update fn (`App::handle_event`), pure draw
  fns, and a pure `map_key`, with the one external service (the server) behind an injected
  `Client` trait. That is the ADR-0003 layer-2 enabler; recorded as the general rule in
  `rust-standards` and as a front-of-mind constraint on the `tui-dev` agent.
- **git-standards — the orchestrator's co-author trailer is `claude <claude@organized-koala.local>`,
  and that applies to Board-only commits too.** The 0004 board-claim commit used
  `<noreply@anthropic.com>` (the reviewer's nit). Tightened the existing footer rule to pin the
  orchestrator's domain form explicitly and state `<noreply@anthropic.com>` is never correct here.

Deliberately **skipped** (did not earn a durable edit): no `CLAUDE.md` gotcha — this cycle hit
no new recurring miss (the three-home model and #6 held cleanly; the auto-discovery of the crate
via `members = ["crates/*"]` and the lib+bin split are already captured). No `docs-standards`,
`bash-standards`, or `coding-standards` change — nothing new surfaced there. No new ADR — TUI-only.

Backlog deferred per the plan's Assumptions (next cycles, not lost): profile picker / multiple-
profiles switch UX; task edit/delete; Notes; Pomodoro (still gated on ADR-0002 timer authority);
TUI-side tracing/OTel; and the `docs/manual-smoke.md` TTY checklist for raw-mode/teardown
behaviour invisible to `TestBackend`. Also still pending from 0003: the operator-sanctioned
reported-only `./ok.sh coverage` verb over `cargo-llvm-cov` (no hard threshold) — `architect` to
plan as a new `main`-side Board item.

**Sequencing — the foundational slice closes with this merge.** Merging
`feature/0004-tui-foundational` puts all three children (0002/0003/0004) on `main`, so parent
0001's end-to-end acceptance (register/login → profile → task add/list/close, TUI ↔ contract ↔
server ↔ Postgres) becomes closeable. `0001` is the only foundational item left open after this.

**Homes.** Cross-cutting edits on `main` (homes #1/#3): this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the "What
works right now" snapshot refreshed), the `rust-standards`/`git-standards`/`tui-dev` learnings,
`docs/build-plan.md`, and the regenerated `board/README.md`. **Feature-local on the branch
(home #2):** the item's `## Summary`. The orchestrator advances the branch status to
`awaiting-merge` after this; **`main`'s frozen copy of `board/features/0004-tui-foundational.md`
is left untouched** at the claim snapshot until the human's merge.

## Handoff — 2026-06-12 (0003 feedback re-entry — four human items resolved, re-verified, `awaiting-merge`)

**Feedback re-entry, not a fresh feature.** 0003 was at `awaiting-merge` (verified `f67a883`)
when the operator authored four `[human]` items in its Log. `architect` triaged them; the cycle
ran forward (triage → fixes → review → verify) and the item is back at `awaiting-merge` on its
branch. The four resolutions:

- **#1 (suggestion) — compose server healthcheck.** `7833b15` (platform-dev): a `healthcheck:`
  on the compose `server` service hitting pure-liveness `GET /healthz` on the in-container port
  8080, plus `curl` added to the slim runtime image. The verifier observed the container reach
  Docker `healthy` for real (probe ExitCode 0 in-container).
- **#2 (question) — no unit tests / coverage DoD.** Answered + a real gap closed. Zero server
  unit tests is policy-consistent (the public API is HTTP; coding-standards favours public-API
  coverage — 28 such tests exist). But `4c679bd` (tester) closed a **genuine** gap:
  expired-token→401 was untested at *every* layer, while a prior slice-5 Log entry had falsely
  claimed "source-owned jwt unit tests" that never existed. Closed at the HTTP layer by
  hand-signing an hour-past-`exp` token (outside jsonwebtoken's 60 s leeway) → 401
  `unauthenticated`, with a fresh-token control. **The coverage-DoD-in-CI part is a separate
  `main`-side decision the operator SANCTIONED:** add `cargo-llvm-cov` behind a new `./ok.sh
  coverage` verb for a **REPORTED** coverage metric with **NO hard threshold** — to be planned as
  a new Board item (see follow-up below). Not created here (that is `architect` planning).
- **#3 (nitpick) — redundant custom `Debug`.** `353026f` (server-dev): dropped the hand-written
  `Debug` on `Jwt`/`JwtConfig` for `#[derive(Debug)]` (`SecretString` already redacts);
  load-bearing custom impls (`Password`/`AppState`/`TelemetryGuard`) left intact.
- **#4 (question, DoS) — DB hit on every authenticated request?** Clarified, no change. Auth is
  stateless JWT verification with **zero** DB queries (`session.rs:37` → `jwt.rs:63-68`, no
  session table; the user id is the token `sub` claim). The premise did not hold; the only DB
  work on an authed request is the business query itself.

**Verdicts (feedback delta `fca5f53..HEAD`).** reviewer **`REVIEW-STATUS: approved 4c679bd`**;
verifier **`VERIFY-STATUS: verified 4c679bd`** — re-verified live via the sanctioned `./ok.sh
up`/`down` (Docker 29.5.3 / Compose v5.1.4): the `server` container went `starting` → `healthy`
(curl present in the slim image), migrate one-shot exited 0 before server start, regression
spot-check of register/login/task CRUD + error contract green, OTLP export re-confirmed.

**Follow-up the next cycle picks up — operator-sanctioned coverage verb.** A new Board item is
to be planned on `main` (`architect`): an `./ok.sh coverage` verb wrapping `cargo-llvm-cov` that
**reports** a coverage metric with **no hard threshold** (not a DoD gate). `cargo-llvm-cov` is
operator-sanctioned for this; `platform-dev` owns the verb, `eng-manager` documents it. This is
deliberately **not** created here — recorded so it is not lost.

**Learnings captured (each to the smallest right home):**

- **git-standards** — the co-author footer identity is owned by `git-standards`, **never copied
  from a dispatch prompt**. `353026f` committed with `<noreply@anthropic.com>` because the
  orchestrator's dispatch prompt hardcoded that trailer; the `<agent>@organized-koala.local` form
  is the only authority.
- **docs-standards** — two notes: (a) never let a wrapped Board prose line begin with `#` or a
  list-like token — `rumdl fmt`'s auto-fix splits the paragraph with an inserted blank line
  (MD032); reword (e.g. "constraints 1–6"); never blindly accept `rumdl fmt` on prose. (b) A
  successful commit does **not** prove markdown is lint-clean — `.githooks/pre-commit` is a
  secret-scan only; markdown linting is the PostToolUse `.claude/lint.sh` hook and does not gate
  commits, so run `rumdl check --config .claude/rumdl.toml <file>` explicitly.
- **coding-standards** + **reviewer agent** — a "covered by …" claim must name a test that
  actually exists. The slice-5 phantom-test claim let an untested `exp` path reach
  `awaiting-merge`; the reviewer now spot-checks that cited coverage is real (a phantom claim is
  changes-requested).

**Homes.** Cross-cutting edits on `main` (homes #1/#3): this `docs/handoff.md` entry (+ the
"What works right now" snapshot refreshed), the four standards/agent edits above, and the
regenerated `board/README.md`. **Feature-local on the branch (home #2):** the item's `## Summary`
and the four `[x]`-checked feedback items live on `feature/0003-server-auth-profile-tasks` and
return to `main` atomically at the human's merge. `main`'s frozen copy of the item is left
untouched at the claim snapshot.

---

## Handoff — 2026-06-12 (0003 re-verified under the sanctioned mechanism — block cleared, `awaiting-merge`)

**The capability-gap block on 0003 is cleared.** Docker was provisioned by the operator (Engine
29.5.3, Compose v5.1.4), and 0003 was re-verified **under the sanctioned mechanism only** — the
real docker-compose stack via `./ok.sh`, **no external binary acquired, no improvised DB**. This
closes the loop opened by the policy-correction entry below: a `blocked` capability gap is
recoverable.

**Re-entry mechanics.** drive re-entered 0003 at the **verify** phase — there was **zero code
change** (last code sha is still `f67a883`; only Board-only commits follow it), so the reviewer's
**`REVIEW-STATUS: approved f67a883` was preserved** (a board-only commit does not invalidate the
approval; the orchestrator confirmed no code commit follows the approved sha). No re-review was
needed; only the previously-void verifier verdict had to be re-earned live.

**Verifier verdict: `VERIFY-STATUS: verified f67a883`** (on the branch), closing both prior
environmental gaps live under docker:

- `./ok.sh test` — **28/28 green** on the compose Postgres.
- `./ok.sh up` full stack — the ADR-0004 migrate→run `service_completed_successfully` gating
  **proven via `docker inspect`**: the one-shot `migrate` `exited(0)`, and the `run` service
  started ~0.49 s later — never before. (Prior gap-1, the un-booted compose gating, is closed.)
- Full ADR-0005 HTTP surface live with exact codes/bodies; two-user profile isolation → 404
  `not_found`; idempotent re-close (byte-identical `closed_at`).
- **OTLP export observed live** — 31 spans landed in the collector `debug` exporter. (Prior
  gap-2, log-only degraded mode, is closed.)
- Secrets clean in logs/Board; clean teardown (`./ok.sh down`); read-only throughout.

drive then flipped the branch item **`blocked` → `review` → `awaiting-merge`**. 0003 is now at
the AI-terminal state, awaiting the human merge.

**The validated process learning — the recovery loop works end-to-end.** The
**block → escalate → human provisions the capability → re-verify under the sanctioned mechanism**
loop ran to completion and is now demonstrated, not just asserted. The takeaways worth keeping:

- **A `blocked` item is recoverable with zero code churn.** Because the block was purely
  environmental (a missing capability, not a code defect), provisioning docker was sufficient;
  nothing in `crates/server` or `deploy/` changed. The hard-constraint-#6 discipline (block +
  escalate, never engineer around) cost **no** rework — it deferred the *runtime confirmation*,
  not the *code*.
- **Re-entry was at verify, and reviewer approval at the last code sha survived.** The three-home
  Board model held: the cycle's intervening status changes were board-only commits on the branch,
  so `approved f67a883` still names the last code sha. The orchestrator's "no code commit follows
  the approved sha" check is what makes a verify-only re-entry safe — re-review is unnecessary.
- The existing **verifier agent instructions needed no edit** — it already encodes the
  block-and-escalate-on-missing-capability rule and the sanctioned-mechanism-only constraint
  (added in the policy-correction cycle). This re-entry *exercised* those instructions exactly as
  written; no refinement was manufactured.

**Sequencing — merge of 0003 unblocks 0004.** 0004 (TUI, the third and final slice of the 0001
umbrella) depends-on 0003 and becomes claimable once the human merges
`feature/0003-server-auth-profile-tasks`. No new crate dev agent — `server-dev` already owns
`crates/server`.

Docs updated (all on `main` — derived/cross-cutting, homes #1/#3): `docs/handoff.md` (this entry,
plus the "What works right now" snapshot refreshed); `board/README.md` regenerated (home #3,
derived).
**`main`'s frozen copy of `board/features/0003-*.md` is left untouched** at the claim snapshot
(`ready` + pointer) — the branch copy carries the live `awaiting-merge` status and verdicts and
returns to `main` atomically with the code at the human's merge (home #2). No `CLAUDE.md` or
agent/skill edit — the #6 policy and verifier discipline are already in place and were validated,
not changed.

---

## Handoff — 2026-06-12 (policy correction — no unsanctioned binaries; 0003 reverted to `blocked`)

**Operator policy correction, encoded on `main`.** Supersedes the docker-fallback framing in the
0003 entry below. Two linked, load-bearing rules now binding on every agent in every phase
(CLAUDE.md hard constraint **#6** + tightened "Ambiguity policy"):

1. **No agent downloads, installs, or runs an external binary without the operator's explicit
   approval** — including anything written into a dispatch prompt.
2. **A missing capability the Definition of Done needs (docker, a live DB, any required tool)
   sets the item to `blocked` with a precise question and STOPS for human intervention — it is
   never engineered around.** `verified-with-gaps` is for genuinely-minor *inferred* sub-items,
   never for "couldn't run it because a required tool was missing."

**Origin.** In the 0003 cycle docker was absent in the sandbox. The orchestrator authorized the
tester/verifier to "bootstrap a throwaway local Postgres"; they downloaded/ran an embedded
Postgres 16.2 and the verifier reused a leftover `/tmp/pgextract` binary. The operator has
**disavowed** this. The "binary + live-Postgres fallback" verification of 0003 is therefore
**void for sign-off**.

**Status change.** 0003 was moved **`awaiting-merge` → `blocked`** (on its branch — the
orchestrator committed the block + Log entry there; `main`'s snapshot stays frozen at the claim).
It is **not** heading to merge.

**Re-entry plan.** Operator sets up docker → 0003 is re-verified under the **sanctioned mechanism
only** (`./ok.sh up` / the real compose stack, no improvised DB, no downloaded binary) → back to
`awaiting-merge`. The reviewer's **`REVIEW-STATUS: approved f67a883` stands** (cold code review is
unaffected by the runtime gap); only the **verifier verdict is void** until the sanctioned live
pass is done.

**Docs corrected on `main`:** CLAUDE.md (hard constraint #6 + tightened Ambiguity policy);
`.claude/agents/verifier.md` (the 3ac2a46 "sanctioned binary/live-Postgres fallback + merge-time
ask" language **removed** and replaced with report-not-verified + block-and-escalate);
`.claude/agents/tester.md`, `server-dev.md`, `platform-dev.md` (each now carries the
no-unsanctioned-binaries / block-on-missing-capability rule); `bash-standards` (scripts fail loud
and escalate, never fetch+run); `board/README.md` regenerated (0003 → `blocked`). **Kept intact**
(correct learnings from 3ac2a46): the lib+bin rule in `rust-standards`/`new-crate`, and the
net-new-infra carve-out in CLAUDE.md "The Board" home #1.

## Handoff — 2026-06-12 (0003 — server: auth + default profile + tasks + migrations + docker stack)

> **SUPERSEDED in part by the policy-correction entry above (2026-06-12).** The "docker
> unavailable → sanctioned binary + live-Postgres fallback → verified-with-gaps → human boots
> `./ok.sh up` at merge" framing in this entry is **disavowed**. 0003 is **`blocked`**, not
> heading to merge; its verifier verdict is **void for sign-off** pending a sanctioned live pass
> on a docker host. The reviewer's `approved f67a883` stands. Read the entry below as the cycle's
> historical record, not as current policy or status.

Branch: `feature/0003-server-auth-profile-tasks` (last code sha `f67a883`). Slice 2 of 3 of the
foundational slice 0001 — the server side of the tracer bullet, verifiable live over HTTP before
the TUI exists. The cycle ran build → review → verify and stopped at the AI-terminal
`awaiting-merge` on the branch.

What shipped (on the branch):

- **`crates/server`** (binary `organized-koalad`) with the ADR-0004 admin CLI: `run` (default
  no-arg, **never** mutates schema), `migrate` (idempotent), `rollback` (one step default,
  bounded by `--steps`, never auto-invoked). Reversible paired `*.up.sql`/`*.down.sql`
  migrations for `users`/`profiles`/`tasks` (FKs profile→user, task→profile; flat task domain),
  embedded via `sqlx::migrate!`; committed `.sqlx/` offline cache.
- **Auth:** argon2id PHC hashing (constant-time decoy verify for absent users), JWT HS256
  (sub/iat/exp, expiry enforced; secret held as `SecretString`, redacted everywhere), the
  `AuthUser` Bearer extractor. Endpoints per ADR-0005: `register` (user + named default profile
  in one transaction → 201), `login` (username-or-email → 200), `GET /api/profiles`, profile-
  scoped `GET|POST .../tasks` + `POST .../tasks/{tid}/close`, `GET /healthz`.
- **Profile isolation** via ownership-joined queries → unowned/nonexistent profile is **404
  `not_found`** (never 403, no existence leak); title trimmed+non-empty (else 400
  `validation_failed`); close idempotent (preserves original `closed_at`). The thiserror
  boundary maps each case to HTTP status + `contract::ErrorBody { code?, message }` (internal
  causes logged, never sent). `tracing` spans + INFO mutation events on every endpoint; OTLP
  export gated on `OK_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, degrading to log-only when the collector is absent.
- **`deploy/` docker stack** (platform-dev): multi-stage Dockerfile (release build off the
  committed `.sqlx/`, slim runtime as an unprivileged user), `docker-compose.yml` with the
  ADR-0004 graph — Postgres (healthcheck) → one-shot `migrate` (gated `service_healthy`) →
  `run` (gated `service_completed_successfully`) → minimal OTel collector (OTLP/gRPC receiver +
  `debug` exporter). `ok.sh` wired: `up`/`down`, dev-only `migrate`/`rollback` delegating to the
  binary, `run-server`, and a `test` verb that boots a throwaway tmpfs Postgres for the
  `#[sqlx::test]` suite. The committed stack carries **no** credential literal (a gitignored
  `deploy/.env` with DEV-ONLY placeholders is generated by `up`; secret-scan clean).
- **Tests** (tester): 28 integration tests over the public HTTP surface (`auth` 14,
  `tasks` 9, `profile_isolation` 5) driving the real `axum` router in-process via
  `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot` over a per-test `#[sqlx::test]` DB. Every error asserts the exact
  ADR-0005 `code`, not just status.

Verdicts:

- **Reviewer: REVIEW-STATUS approved `f67a883`** — mechanical gate green (`fmt --check`/`lint`/
  `build`/`sqlx prepare --check`/`secret-scan`); no contract drift (server defines no DTO, maps
  at the boundary); endpoints/CLI/compose match ADR-0004/0005; hard constraints #2–#5 held;
  secrets redacted. Two non-blocking nits (unused `app_with_ttl` expired-token helper;
  `cmd_run_server` harmlessly forwards `"$@"` to argless `run`).
- **Verifier: VERIFY-STATUS verified-with-gaps `f67a883`** — docker unavailable in the sandbox,
  so used the sanctioned binary + live-Postgres fallback (real HTTP round-trips, nothing faked).
  Verified live: `./ok.sh test` **28/28 GREEN**, CLI run/migrate/rollback, the **migrate-before-
  serve seam** proven (fresh unmigrated DB: `register`→500 since serve never creates schema;
  after `organized-koalad migrate`, the same running server served `register`→201 with no
  restart), the full ADR-0005 surface with exact codes/bodies, **profile isolation across two
  users** → 404 `not_found`, idempotent re-close, tracing spans/INFO events, and **secrets
  absent from logs**.

Two verifier gaps — environmental, docker-only, NOT code defects:

1. `./ok.sh up` full compose stack + its `service_completed_successfully` migrate→run gating was
   not booted.
2. OTLP span export to the OTel collector was not observed (ran log-only degraded mode).

> **Merge-time action for the human:** boot `./ok.sh up` once on a docker host to close 0003's
> two gaps — confirm the migrate one-shot gates the `run` service and that spans reach the OTel
> collector. The semantics are already proven via the binary + live-Postgres fallback; this is
> the live-stack confirmation the sandbox could not perform.

Process learnings captured this cycle (all on `main`):

- **Net-new infra born with a new crate rides that crate's branch (carve-out to home #1).** This
  cycle deliberately put the `deploy/` stack + the `ok.sh` `up`/`run-server`/`migrate` verbs ON
  the branch — they are net-new and only meaningful because the `server` crate doesn't exist on
  `main` yet, and the verifier needs `./ok.sh up` to work inside the worktree. Landing them on
  `main` early would be an out-of-sync bug in the *other* direction (referencing a non-existent
  crate). This is distinct from the 0002 bug class (*modifying existing* shared infra, which
  stays `main`-only). Added as a narrow, explicitly-bounded carve-out to CLAUDE.md "The Board"
  home #1 with a decision test (when unsure → main-only).
- **A binary crate that will be integration-tested needs a `[lib]` target — scaffold it lib+bin
  from the start.** `tests/` links the crate's library, not its binary; the binary-only `server`
  crate couldn't expose `app::router`/`AppState`/config for in-process tests, blocking
  `./ok.sh test` until `server-dev` added a `[lib] name = "server"` + thin `src/lib.rs`
  (re-exporting the seams) with `main.rs` reduced to a CLI shell (`f67a883`). Recorded in
  `rust-standards` (the rule) and `new-crate` (the scaffold-time action); the `new-crate`
  reference example was also refreshed off the removed `organized-koala` placeholder onto
  `contract` (library) + `server` (lib+bin) as the live exemplars.
- **Docker-unavailable sandbox is a standing verifier limitation.** Every cycle shipping
  compose/OTel infra leaves the `service_completed_successfully` gating and OTLP-export sub-items
  verified-by-reading only; the sanctioned mitigation is the binary + live-Postgres fallback
  (proves semantics) plus the human booting the full stack once at merge. Recorded in the
  `verifier` agent so future verify passes apply it consistently.

Be aware:

- 0003 is **branch-owned** on `feature/0003-server-auth-profile-tasks`; the cycle advanced the
  branch copy of the item (status, reviewer/verifier verdicts, `## Summary`). `main`'s copy stays
  frozen at the claim snapshot (`ready`, with a pointer note) until the human's merge brings it
  back atomically with the code. No new crate dev agent — `server-dev` already owns
  `crates/server`.
- With 0003 heading to merge, **0004 (TUI) becomes unblocked** (it depends-on 0003). 0004 is the
  third and final slice of the foundational 0001 umbrella.

Docs updated (all on `main` — shared/cross-cutting, home #1): `docs/handoff.md` (this entry);
`CLAUDE.md` "The Board" home #1 (the net-new-infra carve-out); the `rust-standards` +
`new-crate` skills (the lib+bin rule + refreshed reference example); the `verifier`
agent (docker-unavailable fallback); `board/README.md` regenerated (home #3, derived). The 0003
item's `## Summary` was filled **on the branch** (home #2).

## Handoff — 2026-06-12 (0002 re-entry — human feedback: chrono timestamps + test-layout)

Two `[human]` feedback items on the already-verified, `awaiting-merge` 0002 re-opened the cycle.
`architect` triaged both; the cycle ran forward on `feature/0002-contract-crate` and stopped at
the AI-terminal `awaiting-merge` again. Both feedback boxes are now `[x]`.

What shipped (on the branch):

- **Feedback-1 (chrono):** contract timestamps are now `chrono::DateTime<Utc>`
  (`Task.created_at`/`closed_at`, `Profile.created_at`) instead of opaque strings — consumers
  get a typed timestamp and malformed dates now fail to parse. `chrono` added pure-DTO
  (`default-features = false, features = ["std","serde"]` — no clock/IO surface). **Wire bytes
  are unchanged** (RFC 3339 `…Z`, `closed_at: null` still emitted), so it sits **inside**
  ADR-0005's frozen wire format — **no wire change, no ADR.** Commits `bc61626` (contract),
  `98d1a85` (tests); reviewer approved `98d1a85`, verifier VERIFIED — 41 integration + 12
  doctests = 53 green.
- **Feedback-2 (test layout):** resolved as a **clarification, no code change**. The
  `contract` crate is pure-DTO — its whole surface is public — so the crate-root `tests/`
  public-API suite plus doctests is the correct, complete layout; there is no private logic for
  `module/tests.rs` to cover. Captured as a durable rule in `rust-standards` on `main`
  (`8b56ed2`).

Process point worth keeping (the durable learning of this re-entry):

- **A pure-Rust-representation change on an `awaiting-merge` item, with identical wire bytes,
  does NOT need an ADR.** ADR-0005 froze the *wire format*; it explicitly delegates the Rust
  representation (chrono vs string, enum-with-catch-all, etc.) to `contract-owner`. Swapping the
  in-crate type while the serialized bytes are byte-identical stays inside that delegation.
  **Contrast:** a change to the wire shape itself (a renamed/added/removed field, a changed
  encoding the other side observes) IS an ADR event and ripples to both consumers (CLAUDE.md
  hard-constraint #2). The reviewer guarded the boundary by holding the exact-byte assertions
  (`…Z` suffix, `closed_at: null` emitted) unweakened.
- The re-entry mechanics held: the **unchecked box was the only re-entry signal**;
  `architect` triaged to the smallest re-entry point (behaviour tweak, not a redesign); the
  owning agent checked the box `[x]` only after on-branch resolution + re-review. Zero blast
  radius because 0003/0004 are not built yet.

Be aware:

- 0002 remains **branch-owned** on `feature/0002-contract-crate`; the chrono delta advanced the
  branch copy of the item (status, re-review/re-verify verdicts, Summary) — `main`'s snapshot
  stays frozen at the claim until the human's merge. 0003 (server) is still `ready` and
  unblocked once 0002 merges; 0004 (TUI) follows 0003.
- No new crate dev agent — `contract-owner` still owns `crates/contract`.

Docs updated (all on `main` — shared/cross-cutting, home #1): `docs/handoff.md` (this entry);
`.claude/skills/rust-standards/SKILL.md` (the pure-DTO test-layout rule, `8b56ed2`);
`board/README.md` regenerated (home #3, derived). The 0002 item's `## Summary` was updated for
the chrono change **on the branch** (home #2).

---

## Handoff — 2026-06-11 (0002 — contract crate + workspace restructure)

Branch: `feature/0002-contract-crate` (head `638eef1`, last code `56833a6`, linear atop `main`
`ed9510e`, fast-forward — frozen for the human to merge). Slice 1 of 3 of the foundational
slice 0001.

What shipped:

- Removed the `crates/organized-koala` placeholder; the workspace now matches the target
  `contract`/(`server`)/(`tui`) layout. `crates/contract` authored as the single source of
  truth for the foundational wire shapes per ADR-0005.
- DTOs: `RegisterRequest`, `LoginRequest`, `SessionResponse`, `Profile`, `Task`, `TaskStatus`,
  `CreateTaskRequest`, `ErrorBody { code?, message }` + the 7 stable error codes with a lossless
  `Unknown` catch-all; a `Password` newtype (transparent serialize, `[REDACTED]` Debug).
- 37 serde/wire-format integration tests + 12 doctests green; build/lint/fmt clean. Reviewer
  approved at code head `56833a6` (re-attested after the rebase); verifier confirmed the
  pure-DTO seam (live-stack E2E deferred to 0003/0004 per ADR-0003).
- Planning artifacts (ADR-0005 + the 0002/0003/0004 plan) were committed to `main` as
  `1a2540c` before the worktree was finalized.

Process learnings captured this cycle (these will bite 0003/0004 if ignored):

- **State has three homes, by which side of the `main`↔branch line it belongs on.** This is THE
  process learning of the cycle, and it supersedes the earlier (wrong)
  "Board-authoritative-on-`main`, branches code-only" framing, which added a transcription step
  and still stranded cross-cutting state on the wrong side of the line — the root cause of BOTH
  out-of-sync incidents this cycle. The corrected model (now in CLAUDE.md "The Board"):
  1. **Shared / cross-cutting → `main` only, never on a feature branch.** ADRs + the decisions
     index, infrastructure (`ok.sh`, `.githooks/`, docker/compose, OTel config), `CLAUDE.md`,
     the standards skills, and `.claude/` agent/skill defs. A change to any of these riding a
     feature branch IS the out-of-sync bug class.
  2. **Feature-local → on the feature branch, in the worktree.** The
     `board/features/NNNN-<slug>.md` item travels with the code: status flips, per-slice Log,
     reviewer/verifier verdicts, and the `## Summary` are all committed on the branch. A clean
     revert is just dropping the worktree + branch; concurrent worktrees never contend on a
     shared Board file; a verdict on the branch is immutable evidence tied to its sha.
  3. **Derived → regenerated on `main`.** `board/README.md` from item frontmatter + branch heads.
  Lifecycle: born on `main` during planning, **branch-owned on claim** (the branch copy advances,
  `main`'s copy freezes at the claim snapshot until the human's merge brings it back atomically
  with the code). reviewer/verifier are **read-only on everything** (code AND Board) and report
  verdicts back; the orchestrator commits them on the branch. A Board-only commit does not
  trigger re-review — only a new code/test commit does. Codified in `drive`/`plan`/`review` and
  the `architect`/`reviewer`/`verifier` agents.
- **The secret-scan hook fix was relocated from the 0002 branch to `main`.** This cycle
  `platform-dev`'s `.githooks/secret-scan.sh` fix was wrongly committed on the 0002 feature
  branch, leaving `main`'s scanner stale — a textbook instance of cross-cutting state (home #1)
  riding a feature branch. It has been moved to `main`; the three-home rule above exists to
  prevent the recurrence.
- **Plan/ADR must be committed to `main` before the worktree is cut.** This cycle the ADR-0005
  artifacts were left uncommitted, the worktree was cut from the pre-ADR commit, and the code's
  `(see ADR-0005)` citations dangled — contract-owner flagged it as a blocker; recovered by
  committing to `main` and rebasing. Now a corollary of the three-home model (an ADR is home #1,
  and a worktree cut from a commit that lacks it cannot see it). Codified in `plan` + `drive`,
  the `architect` agent, and CLAUDE.md.
- **secret-scan matches credential VALUES, not bare identifiers** (now `d34570c` on `main`; the
  branch's original `37b78c4` was dropped when the fix was relocated): a bare Rust field
  declaration (keyword + bare type + comma, no separator/literal) no longer false-positives;
  assigned literals still trip. One known non-blocking gap recorded for future platform-dev (the
  JSON-object quoted-key/quoted-value form is not caught). Documented in `bash-standards`
  structurally (no matchable literals, so the doc does not trip its own scanner).
- **Markdown MD004:** a wrapped prose line starting with `+`/`*`/`-` is read as a list marker;
  reflow so a symbol is never line-leading. Documented in `docs-standards`.

Be aware:

- No new crate dev agent registered — `contract-owner` already owns `crates/contract`.
- 0002 is **in-flight and branch-owned** on `feature/0002-contract-crate`; its live status lives
  on the branch (where the cycle advanced it), and `main`'s snapshot is frozen at the claim until
  the human's merge. 0003 (server) is `ready` and unblocked (depends-on 0002); 0004 (TUI) is
  `ready` but depends-on 0003. 0001 is the umbrella (`planned`), tracking its three children.
- 0003 handles real credentials/JWTs — wrap secrets so they never reach `Debug`/`Display`/logs;
  do not rely on the secret-scan as the safety net.

Docs updated (all on `main` — shared/cross-cutting state, home #1): `docs/handoff.md` (this
entry, re-corrected to the three-home model); CLAUDE.md "The Board"; `docs/build-plan.md`;
`board/README.md` regenerated; the `plan`/`drive`/`review` skills; the
`architect`/`reviewer`/`verifier` agents; the `bash-standards`/`docs-standards` skills. The
secret-scan hook fix was relocated from the 0002 branch to `main`. The 0002 item's
`## Summary` + Log live on the branch (home #2).

---

## Handoff — 2026-06-10 (Bootstrap — workflow scaffold)

Branch: `main`.
Stood up the AI development workflow per BOOTSTRAP.md: the agent team, skills, Board, and docs
system for organized-koala. No application code yet — this cycle established *how* work runs,
not *what* it does.

What shipped:

- `CLAUDE.md` constitution (purpose, stack, `ok.sh` ops, 5 hard constraints, error contract,
  ambiguity policy, Definition of done, trigger tables).
- 9 agents in `.claude/agents/` (architect, contract-owner, server-dev, tui-dev, platform-dev,
  tester, reviewer, verifier, eng-manager); read-only roles omit Write/Edit.
- Skills in `.claude/skills/`: drive, plan, grill, review, coding-/rust-/docs-/bash-standards,
  repo-map, autowork, autoreview.
- `ok.sh` operations entrypoint; `.githooks/` pre-commit secret scan (hooksPath enabled).
- `docs/adr/0001-foundational-architecture.md` + decisions index; this handoff; build-plan.
- `board/` with the dashboard and feature `0001` (foundational vertical slice) in `inbox`.

Be aware:

- `.claude/settings.json` (the permission allowlist) was **not** written by the bootstrap — the
  harness auto-mode classifier blocks an agent authoring permission rules. The human must add it
  (content is in the bootstrap conversation / README of this cycle).
- The `crates/organized-koala` placeholder still exists; feature 0001 restructures it into
  `contract` / `server` / `tui`.
- ADR-0002 (timer authority) is pending and gates Pomodoro work.

Docs updated: ADR-0001 created; CLAUDE.md authored.

### What works right now

- The **workflow** is in place: run `/drive` to advance the Board one item to `awaiting-merge`.
- **The `contract` crate is merged on `main`** (0002): a compile-only, pure-DTO seam carrying
  the foundational wire shapes (auth/profile/task DTOs, `ErrorBody`, error codes, the redacting
  `Password` newtype) per ADR-0005, with `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` timestamps (wire bytes
  unchanged — RFC 3339 `…Z`). The workspace matches the target layout (placeholder crate gone).
- **The server is merged on `main`** (0003): `organized-koalad` implements the full ADR-0005
  HTTP API against Postgres — argon2 + JWT auth, the atomically-created default profile,
  profile-scoped add/list/close tasks, the `{ code?, message }` error contract, the ADR-0004
  `run`/`migrate`/`rollback` CLI, reversible migrations, `tracing`/OTLP instrumentation, and the
  `deploy/` docker stack (compose `server` healthcheck on `/healthz`). Merged after a four-item
  human-feedback re-entry; reviewed + live-verified under the sanctioned docker mechanism.
- **The TUI is merged on `main`** (0004): `organized-koala` (ratatui/crossterm/reqwest) completes
  the loop — register/login (auto-selecting the single default profile), task list (newest-first,
  done/undone markers, add Title+Description, mark-done), ADR-0005 error-code branching
  (`unauthenticated`→login, `validation_failed`→inline, offline→blocking+retry), and statelessness
  (JWT + active profile id in process memory only). Built as a pure core (update fn + draw fns +
  `map_key`) behind an injected `Client` trait, so the whole interactive surface is `TestBackend`-
  tested (ADR-0003 layer 2). Reviewed + live-verified over the full reqwest path.
- **The foundational slice 0001 is CLOSED.** With 0002/0003/0004 all on `main`, the umbrella
  0001 merged too — the end-to-end tracer bullet TUI ↔ contract ↔ server ↔ Postgres is complete.
- **The TUI responsive event loop is MERGED on `main`** (0005): the TUI no longer freezes
  during an HTTP request — it keeps rendering, animates a spinner with a "working… (Esc to
  cancel)" hint, and stays interactive in flight. Per [ADR-0006][adr-0006] Model A: a synchronous
  `Client` on a worker thread, `std::sync::mpsc` request/response, a polled (`event::poll`) render
  loop — **no async runtime**. The `App` core is now client-free with two pure seams
  (`handle_event`/`apply_response`); one request in flight at a time (transient `pending:
  Option<RequestId>`), cancel is user-perceived (stale-`RequestId` response dropped). `tui::app`
  was reorganized into `auth`/`task_add`/`task_list` submodules + `protocol.rs`. TUI-only —
  `contract`/`server` unchanged. Reviewed + live-verified (code-hash
  `bc89672d4be5cdecd0bb54b340a24a5b8741cf21`); fast-forwarded to `main` at `6f9a80a`, worktree +
  branch removed.
- **The `chore` Board item type now exists** (governance, learned-0005 follow-up): a lightweight
  lane for scope-limited maintenance (refactors, doc fixes, test-only, dep bumps) with no
  behaviour/`contract`/domain change — orchestrator-mintable, on a lighter DoD (gates + an
  invariant-attesting cold review; live verifier skipped). See CLAUDE.md "Definition of done" +
  "The Board". **First trip through the pipeline complete and MERGED — `0006`** (the
  `tui/src/main.rs` stale-doc-comment fix) ran mint → claim → build → invariant-attesting cold
  review → verify skipped → `awaiting-merge`, then fast-forwarded to `main` (code-hash
  `401ad3de59c4cc7e33c3ebf8308c171d80659e4e`); the chore lane needed zero process correction.
- **The account-global Pomodoro focus timer is MERGED on `main`** (0008, the
  first Focus-phase feature; live-verified): a new `contract` `timer`
  module (`TimerConfig`, `UpdateTimerConfigRequest`, the tagged `TimerSession` enum carrying
  `ends_at` + `server_now`), five account-global `/api/timer/...` server endpoints keyed on
  `user_id` (config get/update, session get/start/stop) with a reversible migration creating
  `timer_configs` + `timer_sessions` (`ends_at` derived, not stored), and a TUI presentation whose
  live `MM:SS` countdown is **render-only** — recomputed each ~80 ms draw from the server's
  absolute `ends_at` + `server_now` + a monotonic `Instant`, never a stored counter (#1-safe;
  inside [ADR-0006][adr-0006], no per-second polling). Account-global (#4 / ADR-0002 §5), flat (#3,
  duration the only knob); the contract/domain surface carries no new/amended ADR
  ([ADR-0002][adr-0002] governs). **After the 0008-R1 feedback re-entry (TUI-only):** the timer is
  an **always-visible global widget** in the bottom-right of every post-auth screen (no dedicated
  page), toggled by a global **`p`** (start/stop) that is listed in the bottom-left help caption;
  the in-flight indicator **appends a trailing spinner** to the stable caption instead of replacing
  it (flicker fix), and the coarse session refresh loosened ~5 s → ~1 min — all governed by the
  [ADR-0006][adr-0006] **§8 amendment** (TUI presentation only; ADR-0002 authority/render model
  unchanged; no `contract`/server/migration change). Reviewed **approved** and live-**verified** at
  the 0008-R1 end state, both pinned to code-hash `3fa0adefce8cd6d67ae716dae7a24ce6dbf9defd` on
  `feature/0008-pomodoro-timer` (the original 0008 build was approved + verified at
  `708ee8d0085ce9b3af68eb7e1b76dbe56a6185da`, voided when the re-entry moved the tree).
  Fast-forwarded to `main` at `c32f0ad`; worktree + branch removed.
- **The report-only `./ok.sh coverage` verb is MERGED on `main`** (0007, a
  `chore`): `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only`, reusing
  `cmd_test`'s live-DB wiring (throwaway test Postgres booted + torn down on a `RETURN` trap), in
  the no-arg usage/help. **No threshold, not a DoD gate** — purely reported (operator-sanctioned
  shape: coverage visible, not a brittle bar). Baseline at implementation: ~66% line / ~66%
  function / ~61% region. Tooling-only (no crate source/behaviour/`contract`/domain change), so it
  ran the lighter chore DoD: gates green + a cold reviewer **approved** attesting the chore
  invariant, pinned to code-hash `3fa0adefce8cd6d67ae716dae7a24ce6dbf9defd` on
  `feature/0007-ok-coverage-verb`; the live verifier pass was correctly **skipped**. The 0003
  "sanctioned follow-up" is now consumed. Fast-forwarded to `main` at `6860b28`; worktree + branch
  removed.
- **Coverage is now captured in the cycle and recorded in each item's Summary** (0009, a
  `main`-only governance `chore`, at `awaiting-merge` on `main` after this step): `drive` step 6
  runs `./ok.sh coverage`, parses the headline workspace coverage %, and writes a `coverage: NN.N%`
  line (or `coverage: unavailable (docker)`) into the item's `## Summary` on **every** cycle
  (feature and chore). **Report-only — never a gate** (no threshold, not a DoD clause, never blocks
  `awaiting-merge`); consistent with the "How to run" `coverage` row and 0007. Three governance
  edits (drive SKILL, CLAUDE.md DoD note, eng-manager charter), applied directly on `main` with **no
  worktree**; cold reviewer **approved** with the chore invariant attested (code-hash
  `3fa0adefce8cd6d67ae716dae7a24ce6dbf9defd`), live verifier **skipped**. 0009's own Summary is the
  first to carry a coverage line: 66.36% line / 61.48% region / 66.67% function.
- **Notes — the final domain feature — is `merged` on `main`** (0010, a
  `feature`, live-verified; the operator performed the final merge): the last missing flat feature,
  a near-exact structural clone of the
  task surface governed by [ADR-0007][adr-0007]. A new `contract` `note` module
  (`Note { id, title, content, created_at }`, `CreateNoteRequest`, `UpdateNoteRequest`, no new
  `ErrorCode`, no `updated_at` — flat #3); five profile-scoped server CRUD routes under
  `/api/profiles/{id}/notes` (create 201 / list 200 newest-first / get 200 / update 200 in-place /
  delete 204), every query ownership-joined so an unowned/missing profile or note id is `404`
  (never 403, #4), with a reversible migration `20260612163049_notes` (`ON DELETE CASCADE`,
  `(profile_id, created_at DESC)` index); and a TUI `Screen::Notes` view (list + create/edit/delete)
  opened by `n` from the task list, stateless (#1), reqwest client maps one-for-one to the wire.
  Tests in all three crates (`contract` 11, `server` 28, `tui` `TestBackend` 13). Reviewer
  **approved** + verifier **verified**, both pinned to code-hash
  `46c1c60f1eb3865eb127a72502982827ebb09d65`; coverage 68.24% line. With Notes merged, all four flat
  features (TODO, Pomodoro, Notes, Profiles) exist except Profiles CRUD (0012, still `ready`).
- **Task update/delete/reopen is MERGED on `main`** (0011, a `feature`, live-verified): the
  one-way task `close` generalized into full edit / toggle-done / reopen / delete — a
  **breaking** change ([ADR-0008][adr-0008-0011]) that **removes** the
  `POST .../tasks/{id}/close` route (clean removal, single in-repo consumer, ADR-0005 §8). A new
  `contract` `UpdateTaskRequest { title?, description?, status? }` (all-optional partial, no
  `updated_at`, #3); `PATCH …/tasks/{id}` via one static `UPDATE … RETURNING` (`COALESCE`/`CASE`:
  done→`closed_at` set, open→cleared, empty patch a 200 no-op, blank title → 400) + `DELETE …/tasks/{id}`
  (204 / 404), both ownership-joined → 404 never 403 (#4), **no migration**; the TUI gains edit/
  toggle/delete keys (`e`/`c`/`x` with two-step confirm), stateless (#1). It was re-rebased onto
  post-0010 `main`, which pulled the merged Notes feature into its `crates/` tree, **changing its
  code-hash** to `ee5047c9abf1e4196ed1933655a61fcf41148bcb` and forcing a re-review/re-verify (both
  re-passed); an operator-authorized doc-only README fix then moved the hash to
  `97cbc025523bdff1907e9552fd3636d3a874b589` (verdicts carried forward by authorization).
  Fast-forwarded to `main` at `9635608`; worktree + branch removed.
- **Profiles create/update/delete + TUI switcher is MERGED on `main`**
  (0012, a `feature`, live-verified — **the final
  domain feature; organized-koala is now functionally complete**): the only profile surface was
  list + register-time bootstrap; 0012 adds `POST /api/profiles` (201), `PATCH /api/profiles/{id}`
  (200), `DELETE /api/profiles/{id}` (204) under [ADR-0009][adr-0009], plus a client-side TUI
  switcher. New `contract` `CreateProfileRequest`/`UpdateProfileRequest` + two **append-only** error
  codes `ProfileNameTaken`/`LastProfile`. Server: race-safe DB unique-violation → `409
  profile_name_taken` (no TOCTOU); atomic last-profile guard → `409 last_profile` (account keeps ≥1
  namespace); delete **cascades** the profile's tasks **and** notes via FK `ON DELETE CASCADE` (#4);
  reversible `UNIQUE (user_id, name)` migration ordered after 0010. TUI `Screen::Profiles` switcher
  (`s`; `a`/`e`/`x` create/rename/delete): **switch is client-side only** — rebinds the in-memory
  `active_profile_id`, no server endpoint, no persistence (#1); deleting the active profile
  re-points to the first remaining. Reviewer **approved** + verifier **verified** (live cascade
  DB-confirmed `tasks=0, notes=0, profile=0` + 404), both pinned to code-hash
  `71fb7ecf327fbd42a14cb19456207885c782fe49`; coverage 66.91% line. The cycle's load-bearing
  learning — `./ok.sh prepare` is now self-contained (`3e0094b` on `main`), completing the
  "every DB-needing `ok.sh` verb self-boots the shared test PG" pattern (`test`/`coverage`/`prepare`).
  Fast-forwarded to `main` at `685b4de`; worktree + branch removed. The reviewer's pre-existing
  `Session.token` JWT-`Debug`-leak nit was promoted to **0013** (high `chore`).
- **The session JWT `Debug` leak in the `tui` is at `awaiting-merge` on
  `feature/0013-session-token-debug-leak`** (0013, a high `chore`, cold-review-approved; live
  verifier correctly skipped): the bearer JWT, previously a bare `String` reachable from a derived
  `Debug` on `Session` + all 17 `ClientRequest::*` variants + `Outcome::ListProfiles`, is now held in
  a `SessionToken(String)` newtype (`crates/tui/src/app/token.rs`) with a hand-written `Debug` →
  `[REDACTED]` and an `expose()` accessor used only at the point the `Authorization: Bearer` header
  is attached. Mirrors the in-repo `contract::Password` template (chosen over `secrecy` to avoid a new
  dependency for one field); the wire bearer string is byte-identical. `tui`-only — no `contract`/wire
  (#2), no domain (#3), no behaviour change beyond `Debug` rendering. Reviewer **approved** with the
  chore invariant attested (code-hash `e5925c5139e52846d8593c4be3ab2d0516d49fa0`); coverage 66.90%
  line. This cycle sharpened `rust-standards` with a callout on the
  `missing_debug_implementations`-lint-vs-secret-redaction tension (the root cause that let this leak
  survive from 0004 through 0011 under diff-scoped cold review). Merged on `main`.
- **The TUI layout shell is MERGED on `main`** (0014, Phase 1 of the three-part TUI overhaul, a
  `feature`, live-verified): a **`tui`-crate-only** reshape of the structural shell with **no**
  `contract`/server/domain change ([ADR-0010][adr-0010-0014-snap] §5 boundary). `Screen::TaskList`/
  `Notes`/`Profiles` collapsed into one `Screen::Main(Box<MainState>)` holding the active
  `Tab{Tasks,Notes,Profiles}` + all three live panes (new `crates/tui/src/app/main_view.rs`);
  `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` cycle tabs (arrows move list selection), each switch re-derives the pane from a
  fresh server load for the active profile (#1, #4) preserving the row; removed `n`/`s`/idle-`Esc`-back
  and the old cross-screen events; `t` left unbound for 0016. `Session`/`AuthState` gained a
  client-captured `account: String` (no new wire); centred bounded auth form, centred verbatim title
  `organized koala - <user> @ [<profile>]`, footer flushed to the bottom. Reviewer **approved** +
  verifier **verified**, both pinned to code-hash `bf65aa9612bf1633bf75e64f66a3dfddcfb4aa10`; coverage
  72.96% line. ADR-0010 binds 0015/0016. Fast-forward merged into `main`.
- **The TUI dialog system is MERGED on `main`**
  (0015, Phase 2 of the TUI overhaul, a `feature`, live-verified): a **`tui`-crate-only** modal
  framework with **no** `contract`/server/domain change ([ADR-0010][adr-0010-0014-snap] §5 boundary,
  confirmed byte-identical). A deep `draw_dialog` helper (one `Dialog` fed by all six dialog kinds +
  the help overlay) floats centred over the tabbed view via `Clear` + `centered_rect`; task/note/
  profile add+edit+delete-confirm and the timer duration edit all moved off the 2-row message band
  into dialogs (state machines/error routing untouched — `last_profile` refusal preserved); a `?`
  help modal (transient `App.help_open`, `Event::ToggleHelp`) lists the full hotkey reference and the
  three long `*_CAPTION` constants collapse into one short `FOOTER_CAPTION`; `draw_field` renders a
  focused field's border in `Color::Magenta` (auth + all dialog fields). A single
  `App::overlay_capturing_input()` predicate unifies the scattered text-entry/sub-flow gates: globals
  (`q`/`r`/`?`/`p`/`d`/tab-switch) suppressed while any overlay captures input, two-tiered `Esc`
  (cancels an open overlay, still quits idle post-auth, still cancels in-flight). A tester-flagged
  fix-now made `?` close the help overlay end-to-end (distinct `help_open` param in the 5-arg
  `map_key`) so the advertised `?/Esc: close` affordance works. Tests `tests/dialogs.rs` 21/0 + 380
  total pass; reviewer **approved** + verifier **VERIFIED**, both pinned to code-hash
  `b9884943f36f3ac6c9d56fd2be46e31057a9060a`; the help-modal layout re-entry re-attested at
  `00b1cb162b4c8c9bea9ce1e3eb840c0c50ebafcc`; coverage 73.81% line. Fast-forward merged into `main`;
  0016 unblocked.
- **The TUI detail views + final hotkey scheme are MERGED on `main`**
  (0016, Phase 3 / **final** of the TUI overhaul, a
  `feature`, live-verified): per-field **task & note detail views** (each field its own bordered pane,
  opened with `Enter`, panes cycled with `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` **between editable panes only** —
  read-only panes stay rendered but are skipped, with initial/fallback focus on the first editable
  pane, `e`→edit / `Enter`→commit-one-field / two-tiered `Esc`) and the **canonical hotkey remap**
  (`c`(done)→`Space`, `x`(delete)→`d`,
  `p`(timer)→`t`, duration-edit `d`→`T`). `tui`-crate-only, presentation-only — **no** new ADR and
  **no** `contract`/server/domain delta (byte-identical, confirmed both ways), implementing
  [ADR-0010][adr-0010-0014-snap] §3–§5. Task detail is a new `crates/tui/src/app/task_detail.rs`
  (`TaskDetail` sub-state, a `Screen::Main` sub-mode); note detail converted `NotesMode::Viewing` →
  editable `NotesMode::Detail`; the existing `Event` alphabet was reused (no new variants). Commits
  re-derive from the server response (#1); the note per-field commit re-sends the snapshot's other
  field (R5, wire unchanged). A7 contract: an open non-editing detail view captures action keys + `Tab`
  but keeps `?` reachable; two-tiered `Esc` modelled via an `Option<String>` edit buffer; all gating
  folded into the existing unified `overlay_capturing_input` predicate (no parallel gate). Tests: new
  `tests/detail.rs` (25, incl. read-only-skip / initial-focus / A6 seams) + re-pinned keymap
  regressions. Reviewer **approved** + verifier **verified** (after a human-feedback focus-cycling
  re-entry — read-only panes excluded from `Tab`), both re-pinned to code-hash
  `18d6445a05b7834320186551a6ee72e1972c3a08`; coverage 72.05% line. The re-entry added one durable
  rule to the `coding-standards` skill (focus traversal skips non-interactive fields, learned 0016);
  no gotcha/agent change. With 0016, **the three-part TUI overhaul (0014→0015→0016) is complete.**
  Operator-authorised fast-forward merge into `main`.
- **Timer-completion desktop notification is at `awaiting-merge` on
  `feature/0017-timer-completion-desktop-notification`** (0017, a `feature`, live-verified): when
  the TUI observes a focus session transition into `Completed` it fires **exactly one** desktop
  notification (title `"Focus timer"`, body `"Your focus session has ended."`; no sound, no
  actions). **`tui`-crate-only**, **no** `contract`/server/migration change and **no** ADR
  (Decision 2 — the only new state is a transient in-memory marker on `Timer`, #1-blessed; #2/#3
  untouched; inside the [ADR-0006][adr-0006] render loop). An injected `Notifier` seam
  (`crates/tui/src/client/notify.rs`, modelled on the sanctioned `Client` boundary, ADR-0003):
  production `DesktopNotifier` wraps `notify-rust` and maps every delivery failure to a silent
  no-op (A2 — writes nothing to the alt-screen). A pure fire-once core on `Timer`
  (`notified_for_session` guard + `notify_pending` one-shot signal): `apply_timer_session` detects
  the Running→Completed edge before overwriting the session, arms+signals once, re-arms on a new
  `Running`/`Idle`, and only arms (never signals) the initial post-login `Completed` (A4).
  `terminal::run<N: Notifier>` fires after draining each worker response — no new request, no new
  poll. **A1 confirmed:** the `notify-rust` default `zbus` pure-Rust backend compiled on Ubuntu
  with **no apt package** (no `dbus` C crate in `Cargo.lock`); the C `dbus` feature is left off
  with a commented rationale. Tests `crates/tui/tests/notifications.rs` (13). Reviewer **approved**
  (no fix-now) + verifier **verified** (13/13 + live `./ok.sh up` over the server-owned
  running→completed timer path), both pinned to code-hash
  `d3fa1fc5b3ed5ac0770085809aac150e25012849`; coverage 72.18% line. The **visual appearance** of
  the notification on a real Ubuntu desktop is the operator's manual confirmation (criterion 4 /
  R2 — no daemon in the verifier env; not a capability gap). Two out-of-scope follow-ups filed as
  ideas on `main` (`ideas/0004` surface delivery failures, `ideas/0005` move `.show()` off the
  poll loop). No CLAUDE.md gotcha or standards/agent change this cycle. Awaiting the human's merge.
- **The Notes detail Content field is a multiline text area, at `review`/in-flight on
  `feature/0018-notes-detail-multiline-content`** (0018, a `feature`; verified + approved, awaiting
  the step-7 freshen → `awaiting-merge`): the Content field now **fills the rest of the pane** and
  edits as multi-line text (panes reorder to `Title → Created → Content`). **`tui`-crate-only**,
  **no** `contract`/server/migration change (`Note.content` is already a `String`; the
  `crates/contract`/`crates/server` diff against `main` is empty), implementing
  [ADR-0011][adr-0011-snap] which **amends [ADR-0010][adr-0010-0014-snap] §4** for the multiline
  pane only. Two new `Event` variants (`Commit`/`Newline`) drive a **context-dependent commit
  keymap**: `Ctrl+S` commits while a text-entry context is active, `Enter` inserts a newline
  **only** in the multiline Content edit (predicate `editing_note_content`) and stays `Submit`
  everywhere else; `Ctrl+C` still wins; **no terminal enhancement flags** (Shift+Enter rejected as
  terminal-dependent). Content fills via opt-in `DetailPane.fill` → `Constraint::Min(3)` +
  `Wrap { trim: false }` (task detail unchanged). Tests in `tester`'s `TestBackend` suite per
  ADR-0003 (`tests/detail.rs` 31, `tests/keybindings.rs` 38). Reviewer **approved** + verifier
  **verified**, both pinned to code-hash `1f9db5c40754afb83857a67b71313fd9d2db7ba8`; coverage 72.47%
  line. One out-of-scope follow-up filed as `ideas/0006` (Content scroll/cursor affordance). No
  CLAUDE.md gotcha or standards/agent change this cycle.
- **Sub-tasks are at `review`/in-flight on `feature/0019-task-subtasks`** (0019, a full-stack
  `feature`; approved + verified, awaiting the step-7 freshen → `awaiting-merge`): the **first
  admitted #3 exception** — a task may have **one level** of **title+status-only** sub-tasks (no
  description, no `created_at`, no detail view), per [ADR-0012][adr-0012-snap] (amends #3) +
  [ADR-0013][adr-0013-snap] (wire contract). `contract` `Subtask`/`CreateSubtaskRequest`/
  `UpdateSubtaskRequest`; five profile+parent-scoped server endpoints under
  `/api/profiles/{pid}/tasks/{tid}/subtasks` (+ a per-profile list) joined `subtasks → tasks` on
  `task_id` AND `tasks.profile_id` (cross-reach `404`, #4/A1), reversible `subtasks` migration with
  `task_id` FK **`ON DELETE CASCADE`** (no-orphans R4). TUI: `A` create, `e` edit-title, `Space`
  toggle, `x` collapse (all Tasks-context, routed by row type), a two-call tree load, indented
  render + `+`/`>` indicator, collapse derived from parent status (transient override map, #1), and
  a read-only Task Detail "Sub-tasks" section. Tests: contract 14, server 21 (incl. task- and
  profile-delete cascade), tui `TestBackend` 16. Reviewer **approved** + verifier **verified**, both
  pinned to code-hash `8c500ca092b3c37ec4e95475b794053e470c9077`; coverage 71.22% line. New CLAUDE.md
  gotcha: extending the `tui` `Client`/`ClientRequest`+`Outcome`/screen-`State` surface strands the
  tester-owned `crates/tui/tests/` harness (`--lib --bins` green, `--all-targets` red until the
  tester slice un-strands it). One out-of-scope follow-up filed as `ideas/0007` (TUI key to delete a
  single sub-task — plumbing exists, no keymap reaches it). No new crate, no standards-skill change.
